Braveheart,"Gibson's best as director- melodramatic in better than expected measure, with bloody violence","It was too much to take in upon first trying to watch Braveheart when I was younger. It's story is not terribly complicated, in fact it almost resembles (when taking it out historical context, which is not completely accurate to the film anyway) a 13th century Scottish version of the Mad Max series- Wallace's wife gets killed by the English, he gets revenge, and then some; he faces off in battles to finally gain freedom for Scotland. Clad in blue make-up, using his ""they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" speech, charging ahead, and getting into a truly bloody battle that is only rivaled in 90s war/epic movie-making by Saving Private Ryan, this was what I remembered most from Braveheart when also first writing my comments. Seeing it today it's a totally different experience, as taking in the story it's very well told, with excellent performances that emphasize- unlike in Gibson's Passion of the Christ- that he can really get belief out of melodramatic performances. And when he does get his cameras up into the nitty gritty of violent confrontations, be them small (when he first takes his vengeance on the British after his wife's slaughtered, which itself is a very powerful scene) or large (previously mentioned battle), it's with a vitality and viciousness that rarely gets into Hollywood productions. There are even moments of fun (flashing the British, to 'kiss arse') and close-to-poetry (Wallace's death). It's a handsomely done work that should stand the test of time in Gibson's oeuvre. One of the best films of 1995.",9/10
Left Behind,This is just the beginning......,"Wow.......Nicolas Cage does his best Elvis as a pilot impersonation, and then the plot sort of begins. About thirty minutes into the film, lots of random outfits appear out of nowhere, and coincidentally, lots of really really nice people literally disappear of the face of the earth.Cage is still there though, but he's having an affair. But, the person who he's having the affair with is still there too!. It turns out that all the people who have never sinned, have gone to a better place, and all the sinners have been..............Left Behind!!!Well its a bad film. Within five minutes, the religious undertones have already been stuffed down our throat in the most overblown way possible. A copy of the book 'Acts Of God' is purchased, and a woman has a huge rant at one of the main characters.It also looks really cheap, and the attempts at humour are totally out of place, and just feel way too desperate. And despite it trying to deliver some sort of message, hilariously offensive in some scenes, especially involving one character on the plane (you will know straight away when you see the film).But, and its a really big but, its watchable in so many ways. Cage just looks bewildered the whole way through the film, like he has a gun pointed at his head off camera. The man had one of his greatest performances early in the year with 'Joe', and it ends with this lump hammer of a movie.And its funny for all the wrong reasons. Someone is about to jump from a bridge, and there phone rings, and and the heartbreaking scene where one character hugs her brother, and he disappears, has to be one of the funniest scenes of the whole year. In fact with the added bonus of it looking like people are throwing clothes everywhere, makes it all the more entertaining.But seriously, its a bad film, but I will be watching it again, because it's just so entertaining, and I hope they will make a sequel.It's the new 'The Room'.",4/10
Drishyam,One of most powerful movies ever,"This is a true tour-de-force that has you gripped to your seat.It starts of gently, but don't let that lull you into a false sense of security that nothing much is going to happen - it is! And when it does, the tension doesn't let up.When I saw it the IMDb rating at the time was 8.9, which is very high. All I can say is that it is that high for a very good reason.Not only is it one of the best thrillers I have ever seen, but the cinematography is stunning. It captures the beauty of the location in such rich tones it is worth watching a second time just to admire the thought has gone into this. But it isn't just the large panoramic shots that are terrific, it is also the smaller sets such as the hotel where George goes for tea, and I don't know whether the director intended the contrast between the cold and clinical chief of police's house and the warmer tones of George's family home, but if they did then that was genius.If your heart is not racing by the end of the film you're not alive. Awesome!!!",10/10
Troll 2,"""There's no coffee here in Nilbog... it's the devil's drink."" - Fair enough mate. So bad it's great.","Troll 2 starts as Michael (George Hardy) & Diana Waits (Margo Prey) along with their two children Joshua (Michael Stephenson) & Holly (Connie Young) prepare to go on vacation for a month out in the country in a small town called Nilbog which has a population of 26, hey I said it was small. Once there Joshua quickly realises that the town is full of Goblins since Nilbog is Goblin spelt backwards, he also discovers that the evil Goblins want to turn his family into vegetables & eat them because that's what Goblins eat. Can he save his family & stop the evil Goblins & their queen Creedence (Deborah Reed)?Originally shot under the title Goblins & re-title Troll 2 to cash in on the mildly successful Empire Pictures fantasy horror film Troll (1986) this Italian production was written & directed by Claudio Fragasso under the pseudonym of Drake Floyd & is a unique viewing experience if nothing else. Troll 2 is one of those films which you have to watch, mere word typed on my computer cannot possibly do it justice in how unrelentingly bad yet throughly entertaining it is at the same time. Troll 2 was made by an Italian crew in America with an American cast who apparently offered to make the dialogue sound more natural & actually make sense but the director told them to say it as he wrote it which is why the dialogue is simply hilarious, in an early scene Holly warns her boyfriend that if her father found him he'd 'cut your nuts off & eat them', OK so the cutting off of his nuts is a reasonable sounding threat but then eat them? It just sounds hilarious & the way it's delivered by the actor's add a lot as it's obvious they are uncomfortable with their lines but their being paid to say them so what can they do? The story is quite good in parts, I liked the idea of the Goblins (the word Troll is never mentioned during the film) turning people into vegetables so they can eat them but the ghostly Grandfather thing is awful & the way Joshua saves himself from the Goblins at the end is to start eating a Baloney sandwich in one of single greatest worst moments in cinematic history if that makes sense. I don't know what to say really, Troll 2 is a film that defies any logical explanation, I mean what on Earth was going on with the guy buried under a load of popcorn? It's an impossible film to recommend as it's generally considered by many to be the worst film ever made which is a notion I couldn't disagree more with, hell it's hilariously funny & entertaining so in that respect why is that a bad thing? Sure, it doesn't work on a dramatic level but who said every film ever made had to?Director Fragasso has taken a lot of stick for turning in a film this bad but again I have to disagree that it's the worst directed film ever because it's clearly not, I have seen (or should that be endured?) many films technically & conceptually worse than Troll 2 & that's a simple fact. It's not particularly scary & you should go into Troll 2 with your tongue in cheek. Again some say Troll 2 has the worst special effects ever & again I strongly disagree, I'm not saying the special effects in Troll 2 are good, far from it, but I can point to literally dozens of films which have inferior effects. The Goblins themselves look pretty cheap but their masks are sort of gross, with a bit more time & money they might have looked quite good & their costumes are just potato sacks. There's not much gore, there's a cut off hand & some people 'bleed' green blood but that's about it. A special mention goes to Deborah Reed as the Goblin queen, her performance has to be seen to be believed as it's school panto level, she rolls all of her R's & makes such exaggerated facial movements you can't take your eyes off her, oh & she's a dab hand with a chainsaw too...Made for a couple of hundred thousand dollars Troll 2 has weak production values, it looks cheap mainly because it is although I think it has a certain charm. Shot in a town called Porterville in Utah apparently. The acting is atrocious but extremely watchable in a really hammy way, having said that I can point to films with just as bad performances as this & they weren't trying to make stupid broken English dialogue written by an Italian with little grasp of the language sound plausible. George Hardy is now a successful dentist apparently.Troll 2 is an unbelievable film, it's a film words simply can't do justice. I can't recommend it but I have to say I'd rather watch this low budget laugh a minute horror flick again than something like the dire & drab Hide and Seek (2005) with Robert De Niro which I simply couldn't watch all of & turned it off after 20 minutes because it was so rubbish. Most people seem to hate Troll 2 but I'm not most people & I don't give a damned about anyone else's opinion, I liked it but not for the reasons the makers intended.",5/10
Pad Man,Problem is good,"After months of waiting for an enchanting movie, this is the one I wait for so long. Inspiring, encouraging, funny....Seeing Indian movies and having been to India, I feel that I am quite lucky to be born to a city fair to women. Indian women cannot be her family or go to school during mensuration. Our male lead invents cheap napkins and free women of mensuration.His speech in New York celebrating his invention, without the help of translator, is inspiring and encouraging. Problem, to him, is good chance to find ways to improve.Nothing is impossible. Just preserve your passion and creativity of childhood. Someday your wish will come true.",10/10

Ab Tak Chhappan,Nothing beats,"It was around 2004 after took a glimpse on a trailer, I continued to look for the movie not knowing the title. All I knew was a police story with Nana Patekar (wish to address him Sir) & Revathy. Going around shops describing the movie for almost 8 months only ended after the long list of ""fuyo"" heroics common movies. My hunt was worth as till to date nothings comes near this.Even the 2 top Tamil cop movies which is good, unable to near ATC Ab Tak Chappan. Not many can act without dialog. Nana Patekar is the 1 thing I look forward. Don't miss in Shigard the scene where he will cry after being slapped and continue to laugh as he walks out. Just bought my 4th ATC copy recently. Look forward for ATC2",10/10

Disaster Movie,Oh lord this makes Son Of The Mask a masterpiece,"Disaster Movie is a 2008 spoof comedy that spoofs the likes of No Country For Old Men,The Hottie And The Nottie,Enchanted (yes one of my favourite movies gets spoofed in this film),Juno,Night At The Museum,Hannah Montana,1000BC,Indiana Jones, Juno and many more. For a whooping 88 minutes this film is literally a spoof of a spoof of itself.Movie stars Carmen Electra and yes folks Kim Kardashian(who plays Lisa in this film,hey that's my name and I feel embarrassed now).Do yourselves a favour avoid this piece of trash and if you see it in the bargain bin avoid.Wish I could give it a 0/10. Any wonder Kim ditched the acting after this.",1/10
K.G.F: Chapter 1,A perfect ride for full swing action movie lovers.,"I'm not a big fan of full swing action movies. Still KGF is very good in other technical areas like visual effects and cinematography. Prashanth Neel has done a good job in direction. Yash has also done justice to his role. There are not worthy performances from other actors. Overall, KGF is a one time watcher with a perfect climax setting up for Chapter Two.",5/10

Epic Movie,Epic Movie has WAY lower standards than classics like Airplane! and Blazing Saddles,"When I was a kid I watched movies like Blazing Saddles and Airplane! Both were (and still are) hilariously funny to me and while I knew they both were spoofing certain genres and even certain movies I never thought it was essential to see the original sources in order to get the jokes. Also, while the gags were the thing, I also think a little more attention was paid to both characterization and plot. As a result, little dated either one. Watch something like Epic Movie, however, and you can't help but think they've thrown everything (from various TV shows and movies) but the kitchen sink (and no sink is literally thrown as far as I can tell). This results in such a hodge podge of parodies upon parodies that the plot gets interrupted constantly and characterization (what there is of it) is violated for cheap laughs (of which there were few on my side). I did like the performances of Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge. Otherwise, this was mostly a waste of time for me.",2/10
Mary and Max,chocolate hotdogs....,"A homely, friendless Australian girl picks a name out of a phone book and writes to him, and sends a chocolate bar.She's Mary, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max, living alone in New York, overweight, subject to anxiety attacks.He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings.Mary falls in love, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss.Max has a friendship, and tries to control his weight....This is an oddity of a film. At first glance, I didn't think I was going to enjoy it. The animation is thoroughly depressive throughout, and Humphries narration grates a little.But as the film progresses, you find yourself falling in love with the titular characters, and really hope that they meet come the end.You feel Marys desperation when she upsets the Aspergers suffering Max, and hop all seems lost, when he sends her the typewriter letter.Believe me, come the end of the film, you will be crying like a baby, because its probably the saddest ending to a film I have seen in a very long time.So all in all, it's a wonderfully written film, which starts off a little slow, but all of a sudden, you really get lost into the two characters.",7/10
Rush,Racing on,"I remember as a kid watching the final race of the 1976 F1 season live on television and the tussle between Niki Lauda and James Hunt in the porung rain.It was only when I was older I realised what Lauda had gone through in the earlier part of the season when he suffered a horrendous crash and burns to his body.Rush is a film about two committed, driven, at times equally infuriating and detestable racers.Lauda the calculating, loner from a business minded family who was a well known strategist. He knew how to set up his racing car.Daniel Brühl captures the spirit of this almost cold, aloof character who will then have to recover from an almost fatal accident and make him appear human, even likable.Chris Hemsworth has the showy role as the wild, erratic, playboy James Hunt.The guy always looking to have a good time partying. He is reckless on the track, Hunt the shunt is his nickname.However Hunt as his own demons and in the 1976 Formula 1 season, he spends most of his time chasing Lauda who had a dominant points tally.Unlike other race films, director Ron Howard did not have to try too hard in getting a thrilling storyline. Real life provided it.Lauda was well ahead in the championship until his accident which allowed Hunt to claw back. Lauda miraculously recovered enough despite his burns and returned to racing and the title went to the final race decider.Both actors capture the spirit of the people they portray. Hunt became well known to racing fans after his retirement as a F1 commentator and Hemsworth does well in getting his vocal mannerisms with maybe just a lapse or two to his Aussie accent.I reckon the film would have little interest to those who despise racing but for others there is plenty of thrills here.",7/10
Jaws 3-D,"Jaws 3, Audience 0","It took three screenwriters (Carl Gottlieb, Michael Kane, and the estimable Richard Matheson) to concoct what is surely the lamest suspense movie in history. Chief Brody's oldest son has grown up and become Dennis Quaid, working as a manager at Sea World Florida; after receiving a visit from his sea-shy brother, Quaid, girlfriend Bess Armstrong (who resembles Lorraine Gary, the original Mrs. Brody), and other park employees capture a Great White shark--a feat they will live to regret! Originally shown in 3-D, the movie-monster is mainly seen via underwater stock footage. When an actual Jaws is required, director Joe Alves unveils nothing more than a rubberized dummy. Alves has fun foisting severed limbs (not to mention the head of a fish!) at the camera in an attempt to raise chills, but any audience worth their salt won't be rooting for the swimmers. NO STARS from ****",1/10
Dev.D,Devdas 'Redefined',"DevD is a romantic black comedy movie starring Abhay Deol and debutant Mahie Gill and Kalki Koechlin with Dibyendu Bhattacharya.This movie is a typical Anurag Kashyap Brainchild with Sex, Drugs, liquor and very little violence although Anurag Kashyap is known for violence.The film tells the story of modern Devdas and his life.The movie is been scripted and directed very well and full credit should be given to the director and scriptwriter.The screenplay of the movie is also good and will keep you glued to the movie. Also special mention of the background score of the movie as it supports the scenes with an apt. The special mention to the MMS scandal which shook the country was beautifully linked with the story and also showed the aftermath of that scandal.As far as acting is concerned Abhay Deol is one of the most underrated talent of the Bollywood and he had done an amazing role. Mahie Gill was also very good although she was doing her first film but was very impressive. In my opinion Kalki koechlin is one of the most overrated actress and her immaturity as a fresher can be seen many times during the movie.Overall an entertaining typical 'Anurag Kashyap' movie.",9/10
Ship of Theseus,Intriguing and Thought-Provoking Piece of Independent Indian Cinema!,"Anand Gandhi's first feature-length film is an intriguing and thought-provoking piece of Independent cinema; it deals with life, purpose and philosophy. Gandhi's prior experience with short films helps him direct the three disparate story lines with certain finesse; the stories shed some light on Theseus's Paradox and give a transcendent look at consequences arising from individual actions.In Greek Legend, according to Plutarch, Theseus's ship was preserved, and the decayed parts were replaced piece by piece until no part of the original ship remained. Plutarch asks whether you would call it the same ship or not. The paradox might seem too confusing to discuss, but Anand Gandhi just uses this to connect the three plots through the theme of organ donation, questioning identity in the face of change. Rather than making a statement, Gandhi just raises interest and discusses various important philosophies and issues; having compelling arguments for and against the topics, it helps us being a part of the discussion.The characters are likable and interesting. All the actors have done a commendable job, and Neeraj Kabi's brilliant performance as the Jain monk stands out. As the three stories go, the first one (with the blind Egyptian photographer) deals with behaviour to change, the second one (with the animal-rights supporting Jain monk) might seem more philosophically and intellectually orgasmic, but it's the third one (with a stock broker seeking justice for a kidney scam victim) which oozes with brutal honesty. The use of humour to lighten the serious tone of the movie is delightful.The cinematography is spectacular. Rarely have I seen such breathtaking visuals in an Independent film; the shots have a certain poetic and aesthetic charm. The blend of far-off shots and sudden close-ups gives us an intimate look at the characters' lives.The movie is really good, but far from perfection. 2 hours 20 minutes is too long for the movie; with better editing, it could have maintained the pace and momentum well. And as most movies with multiple story lines suffer from this, the characters lack enough depth and screen-time for us to invest ourselves in them. The first story, though the idea of a blind photographer is a bit far-fetched, suffers from an abrupt ending. The second story has many interesting viewpoints and arguments, but part of them seem off-the-book and pretentious; it suffers from an illogical ending too. The third story, though quite honest and absorbing, is quite messy and detours from the main theme of the movie.From writing screenplay and dialogues for cheesy soap operas to an intellectual independent feature film, Anand Gandhi has come a long way; I guess his experience as a playwright and short-film director must have come in handy.",7/10
Piranha 3DD,Three cheers for the Hoff!,"Piranha 3DD starts with a short recap of the disastrous happenings of Piranha 3D before plunging us into the toothsome little devils' latest escapade - mayhem in a water park. There is some backstory, but it really doesn't matter - all that matters are the sporadic chompings of individuals leading up to the wholesale slaughter which comprises the final section.For those who saw the first movie, there is little to surprise them here - a moderate amount of nudity, a huge amount of gore, a cast of unknowns, and a scattering of cameos (Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames made return visits). There is an attempt to recapture the gleeful sleazy trashiness of its predecessor, although I felt it tried a bit too hard, and lost some of the innocent sense of fun to be had among the severed penis sequences (and, yes, I am quite aware of how ludicrous that sentence sounds).Making up for everything, though, is a wonderfully funny and self-deprecating performance from David Hasselhoff - the Hoff lampoons his own perceived pomposity mercilessly and with pinpoint accuracy. There are some highly entertaining outtakes scattered through the closing credits.",7/10
Rebecca,A sumptuous Gothic...,"Daphne Du Maurier's novel becomes a handsome romantic-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock involving a naïve young woman (Joan Fontaine) who weds a wealthy, mysterious man (Laurence Olivier) and moves into his imposing castle filled with memories of his deceased first wife. Despite a stiff opening reel, ""Rebecca"" is a well-mounted psychological melodrama in the ""Jane Eyre"" vein. Judith Anderson's Mrs. Danvers has been interpreted (and misinterpreted) to death--she's indeed a little grandiose--though it's still a stunning characterization: a steely-eyed villainess who ranks right up there with the most enjoyable cinema-baddies. The movie gushes and flutters over Olivier almost as much as Fontaine does; he's quite good, but this turns out to be Joan's picture. Increasingly insecure, nervous, chatty and overeager, Fontaine runs the gamut of emotions and is never less than compelling. 11 Oscar nominations with two wins: George Barnes for hsi cinematography and for Best Picture. *** from ****",7/10
The Emoji Movie,Not that great!,"Review:
My expectations for this movie really wasn't that high, especially after reading all of the bad reviews but after watching it, I was surprised to see that it actually had a back story. Although it's made for kids, we all can relate to the various apps which are mentioned throughout the film, and the different emoji's which help us to make texting easier but from an entertainment point of view, it really didn't do it for me. The jokes are pretty weak, for kids and adults, along with the storyline which become tedious after a while. Anyway, the movie is based within a phone, were the Emojis live in the city of Textopolis, hoping to be used by the user. Like every phone, each emoji has there own face expression, except for Gene (T.J. Miller) who can change his expressions, which is against there policy. When Gene is finally up to become an emoji on the users phone, he's unable to stick to one expression, which crashes the emoji database. The leader of the emojis, Smiler (Maya Rudolph) is forced to punish Gene for crashing the database, by deleting him all together, so he escapes from Textopolis, with the help of Hi-5 (James Corden) and Jailbreak (Anna Faris), and they try to break back into the phone with Smilers soldiers close behind them. Jailbreak uses her skills to get Gene back into the phone but they have to go through various apps to get through the backdoor in the users phone. While they are doing this, the users phone isn't working properly, so he goes to the App Store to delete all the apps, which will destroy Textopolis. With there life's in danger, and time against them, Gene and his pals have to convince the user that they should stay on the phone, even though Gene caused all of the problems in the first place. It's quite a sweet story, and the relationship between Gene and Jailbreak was quite emotional but it was all a bit childish for me. The animation was half decent but nothing amazing, and the various characters wasn't too bad, especially Hi-5 but there wasn't memorable moments. Personally I think that the director made a bad movie out of a good idea, which is why it didn't go down to well with audiences, even though it made a hefty profit. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed and written by Tony Leondis, 50, who also brought you Lilo & Stitch 2 and Igor. With all of the different emojis, the director could have gone in many directions with this film but he chose to stick to one character, which was a bad choice in my eyes. His previous projects also wasn't that great, so I think that Sony made a big mistake picking him for the project. As I wasn't expecting much from this film, I wasn't that surprised with the outcome so it just has to go down as a bad attempt at a good concept.Budget: $50million
Worldwide Gross: $217millionGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

Udaan,An insightful and must watch take on adolescence with a hidden message.,"Adolescence is one of those rare subjects on which we haven't witnessed many movies made in Bollywood. Therefore UDAAN comes as a pleasant surprise from a debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane, who boldly makes his first movie on an important subject and delivers a fine polished product proving his unique thought process with a style.First of all the film is not preachy as it may seem to be from its look and promos. It's a simple story of a young boy and his relationship with his rigid father and helpless younger step brother told in the most simplistic way. But as it is said, 'The beauty lies in its simplicity', UDAAN becomes worth watching because it's truthfully simple without any added flavors or colors.It starts superbly with its first 20 minutes depicting the mischievous days of 4 young friends living in a boarding school. The sequence of their running from the school to watch an adult movie in the night show sets the mood in for the viewers. But this particular section of the film indisputably belongs to Manjot Singh alone (the young Lucky from 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye""), as he clearly outshines everyone on the screen with his famous realistic dialogue delivery style and comic persona. After its funny half an hour, UDAAN takes a serious turn and then moves into a completely different shell talking about the difficulties faced by a young boy while interacting with his ruler kind of a father. At this stage the narration becomes serious and the pace slows down drastically. But very soon you find yourself involved in this little family of three men living in the same house as strangers.In every family, a young male child always has his own contradictions with his father. There is difference of opinion, difference of vision and most probably the fight is over the issue of the stream or line in which the child desires to make a career in. UDAAN rightly focuses on this relevant issue and therefore every young boy watching the movie would easily relate to the script and the characters in a big way.The movie may not find a thumbs up from every section of the viewers as its basically meant for the fans of realistic cinema who are used to a slower pace and can appreciate the social subject of the script. It also has some minor flaws in its charactersiation like, how can a child steal money and car from his father who has a reign of fear in the family and yet cannot revolt right away. But even after these minor glitches, it still remains a well crafted film standing out of all those usual projects offered to us in 2010.In real terms there are few visible and one invisible aspect of ""UDAAN"", which makes it a worth watching project.The visible aspects mainly include the outstanding confrontation sequences between the father and the son about their different styles of living and choice of professions. Both Rajat Barmecha as the young boy and Ronit Roy as the father truly excel in their scenes together. Then just watch out for the young kid Aayan Boradia, playing the silent step son, who mutely keeps suffering the merciless beatings of his father and doesn't utter a word. He is simply adorable and loving with his innocent smile and dialogues. And then there are two sparkling performances by Ram Kapoor and Manjot Singh. Especially the silent conversation scenes between Ram and Rajat are a treat to watch. Finally the most impactful visible aspect of the movie remains its climax where Rajat along with his writer Anurag Kashyap and director Motwane defines the meaning of their title ""UDAAN"" in an exceptional way. In fact the concluding scene of the movie is capable of lifting up every viewer from his seat in sheer joy.Coming to the invisible but in my opinion the most important aspect of ""UDAAN"", which puts it in a completely different league, is the way it expresses the need of A MOTHER in every child's life. The film makes you feel the incomparable role of a female or a mother in a family who cannot be replaced by any amount of love, compassion or care provided by the other members. A mother, who can finish off all the differences in a family with her kind presence, love and calmness. A mother, who in disguise is just GOD living in our homes for taking care of us in the needy times. And a Mother whose debt we cannot repay in any form in our whole life on this planet.Both the director and the writer need to be congratulated on this hidden aspect of the movie which may not strike all the viewers at first. But if you can think for a moment, then all the sufferings in the movie are only there due to the missing factor in the family called ""MOTHER"".So, in a way ""UDAAN"" also makes you realize this Biggest Gift of God to the mankind by very softly portraying the fact that a family becomes completely dry and stiff in absence of a motherly abode. I hope the film encourages every son or daughter to remember that they are blessed to have their mothers around them in this tender age and they do take care and love her to the best of their abilities forever. Summing up, its a recommended flick since it has an important message for all fathers and families having their kids in the adolescence age. And indeed a must watch for its invisible merit, indicating the role of a Mother in a happy family.(The movie right away moves into my ""Movies To See Before You Die"" list cause it makes you realize the most precious gift of God to us and that's our Mother.)",9/10
Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,A must-see if to see how hysterically bad it is,"I wouldn't put among the worst of the worst, but to be honest Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is not a good movie in my view. However, it is definitely worth seeing to see how bad it is. I do think the film starts off well, the first twenty minutes are refreshing and entertaining. After that, it is a different story, and although it is a mess it is hard not to be entertained by it.First off, while the sets aren't too bad, the effects are hysterically awful and the costumes especially with the martians are pretty hideous. The cinematography is also rather shoddy. The music is okay, but gets too much after a while. With Hooray for Santa Claus, I wasn't sure whether to cry ""Three cheers for Santa Claus"" or ""Bah humbug"".The script is appalling mostly, cloying and unintentionally camp, while the story is incoherent and mean-spirited and there are some real pacing problems especially in the middle. The acting is not great either, John Call initially seemed a good choice for Santa with just the right charisma, but he is too jolly and he looked drunk or out of it in some way. I think a previous commentator is right, maybe he did read the script, knew it was terrible and decided to play along.Overall, pretty bad but entertaining also. 3/10 Bethany Cox",3/10
Dasvidaniya,Best movie of 2008,"Usually all of us make movie-watching decisions based on the reviews we read – IMDb, Rajeev Masand on CNN-IBN, Khalid Mohammed in Hindustan Times or Raja Sen on rediff. If you read at least a couple of these reviews, you usually get a very good idea of what a particular movie is like. I have another personal test – admittedly a sort of rough indicator. In case of mainstream Hindi movies, just look at the schedule of a multiplex when the movie is released. So if a movie has 6-7 shows a day, it's a decent movie – while movies with just 1-2 shows in the first week are just bad. In case of a 'multiplex movie' like Johhny Gaddaar, it's the second week schedule to watch out for.However, sometimes these calculations go quite wrong. Dasvidaniya is one such movie. (In its second week, its running just 2 shows a day in all multiplexes – and all major reviews have given it two stars, blaming the slow narration and/or ridiculing the contents of the final list). And I thought it was one of the best movies of this year.Just for those few of you who don't know what the movie is about, it's about a common man – Amar Kaul – who leads a very dull and inconsequential middle class life, with nothing to look forward to except for his obsession with 'to-do' lists. He makes them everyday, ticking off things that he accomplishes – till he gets to know that he is terminally ill and has just three months to live.As he did during his lifetime, he decides to make a final list – 'Things to do (before I die)' and sets out to fulfill them.But this movie is too much to be summarized by just this one line! Sure that's the essence, but the movie has to be watched to appreciate the wonderfully tender moments captured by the director. Vinay Pathak plays the man with just three months to live, who suddenly has to fulfill a lifetime of ambitions – wishes which had been buried under the daily grind of existence. And the beauty of the script is in the things he chooses to put on the list. Nothing exotic or deliberated. Just simple heartfelt desires that probably most of us have – buying his first car or going on his first 'foreign trip'. Seeing his first and only crush Neha one final time - or meeting his childhood best-friend Rajiv before he dies.Some experiences are heartwarming, like his mom's reaction on seeing the new car - and some bittersweet, like finding out Neha is now married and a mother. There are many more touching moments - the final parting between Rajiv and Amar and making peace with Vivek – which linger on after the movie. Vinay Pathak gives a wonderful performance, first reflecting desperation, then a breakdown and finally a wistful acceptance of fate. Kailash Kher has given his unique touch to the music – and while Alvida is the number which everyone is humming, the Maa song is very nicely picturized (without too much overt sentimentality) – and is catchy too.Not all is perfect with the movie though – Amar's alter ego's appearance is a little jarring and he should have had less screen time. The Russian's popping-up act is also a little weird – but it also gives the movie its unique flavor. And if you think about it, how much money would an account manager's provident fund be left with, after a Rs. 9 lakh car and a round trip to the US ?? And wouldn't you want to leave it all to your mother instead?But inspite of these loopholes, this movie is one of the most warm and thoughtful movies to come out of Bollywood in sometime. The director cheekily doffs his hat to mainstream movies Kal Ho Naa Ho and Munnabhai – and indulges in a bit of genuinely funny situational comedy, but you would remember the movie for touching your heart in its earnestness and simplicity.",10/10
Lawrence of Arabia,One of the greatest movie of all times,"T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) has a minor function in Cairo during WWI. Nobody really cares about the Bedouin uprising against the Turks except for Lawrence and the Arab Bureau. He's sent for 3 months since he would be of no great lost. He learns the ways of the desert, and memorably encounters Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) at a well. He finds Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) harassed by superior weapons, and the British unwilling to take Aqaba from the sea. So Lawrence proposes to take Aqaba from the desert and Feisal gives him 50 men.Director David Lean's vision is absolutely beautiful. The desert is beyond gorgeous. Peter O'Toole is brilliant. There is nothing inferior. It is all first rate. The bigger the screen, the better the movie looks. This is simply one of the best of all times.",10/10
Breach,Worst Movie Willis Has Been In,This movie was really terrible. I had to force myself to watch it to the very end. Even then I was staring at the screen in shock and disbelief at what I had just seen. Sad smoke filled nonsensical combat. Illogical alien behavior. Just bad bad bad writing. It's been a week since I watched it so I can't even recall all the reasons I hated it. What a terrible embarrassment for Willis. He should never have admitted to being in this movie. 2/10.,2/10
Mother India,A Masterpiece,"Mother India sits right at the top and shares the seat with just a handful of other movies as one of the best films ever made in Indian Film History. Deservedly, it also garnered an Oscar Nomination for Best Foreign Film - a first for Bollywood. Need I say more? Let me try...Five years after her wedding, Radha, a regular village girl finds she has been abandoned by her husband (who leaves her in despair) and left to cope with his never-ending debt to Shuki Lal, the village ""Munshi"". To feed her children, Radha toils like a farm-animal and is able to save just enough food to eventually bring up her children. The injustice to and torture of their mother is interpreted in opposite ways by her children: while the elder Ramu is humble and just, the younger Birju who seethes with hatred for Sukhi Lal turns outlaw. While Radha tries to bring back Birju with love, Birju plans to finish Sukhi Lal's debt once and for all.Mehboob Khan had made some good movies in his career, including a milestone first all-colour (technicolor) Bollywood feature. But nothing could have hinted at the brilliance to come in his waning years. Defying a very many stereotypes, his was the first major Hindi film with a female protagonist, a cowardly abandoning husband (how RajKumar, men of men, agreed for that role is another story), no definitive hero-heroine pairs, etc. He tells the 172-minute story in flash-back as a memory of an old Radha inaugurating irrigation canals in her village. Taking his titular heroine through happiness, desolation, compulsion and resignation, he transformed box-office darling Nargis into an actress nothing short of a legend. We see her go from an innocent bride to an anguished mother to a revered ""Mother"" of the village.Nargis herself is most remembered for this career-defining and image-breaking portrayal (soon after which she married Sunil Dutt, who portrayed her bitter son Birju*). Sunil Dutt was a very under-rated actor, for the simple reason that all his great performances were never title characters, and were over-shadowed by more famous co-actors. His Birju is played with such realism and conviction that even today many comedians mimicking Sunil Dutt are actually mimicking Birju.The director's production team does work beyond their era and workstyle to create the look of the people and place over time. From famine to flood for the backdrop, youth to old-age for Radha and from bright to dirty earthen to faded colours, the team wins complete involvement of the audience by filling our visual and audio sense with realism just next to reality. The director chose to spend more of his limited budget on these aspects, and in turn had to sacrifice on the equipment he could use to capture the sights and sounds that were being realised: the movie was made on 35mm and mono-sound.Surprisingly, something I have noted as not being mentioned anywhere in literature connected to this movie is how without obviously being so, Mehboob created the most patriotic of Indian movies. The only give-away is in his choice of title Mother India. Depicting his motherland as a repressed and abandoned woman, and her children as peace-loving Gandhi-Ramu or rebellious Bose-Birju, Mehboob layers his movie with such fierce passion, it is impossible not to be overwhelmed by it.",10/10

Vikram Vedha,Inspired from The Dark Knight!,"It has the similar root theme with The dark knight. Unpredictable role of protagonist and antagonist. The husband wife issue is the Indian one. And apart from that the villain and hero's role is not depthfull, loses grip in the reality. The movie felt like just a raw collection of unreal shots. The storytelling is unoriginal, like raw scenes put together.
A maximum of 5/10 is its best rating, no more than that. I give it a 4 because I saw the dark knight and surpassing dark knight is a hard job really.",4/10

The Shawshank Redemption,Some birds aren't meant to be caged.,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",10/10
Persona,"""But somehow..., I think I could change myself into you if I tried.""","The movie opens with a series of unconnected and somewhat disturbing images - the shearing of a sheep, a nail pounded into a victim's hand a la the crucifixion, dead people on slabs in a mortuary. Quick edits over the opening credits additionally lend a surreal flavor to the picture, so that we have no idea what's coming. If one were to view the opening montage once again after the picture concludes, one might be willing to connect the teenage boy to Elisabet Vogler (Liv Ullman) as the son she bore who she wants no part of. One will have to decide.It seems to me this is the kind of film that's open to one's interpretation in the most personal of ways. Having read a few of the reviews for this movie, there are multiple thoughts on the film that appear just as valid as mine might be, some that even contradict each other. For this viewer, the dynamic between Elisabet and Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson) forces the caretaker to confront her own insecurities about life. In Elisabet, Alma foresees for herself a failed marriage, children she doesn't want, and abandoning a job that she likes for the sole reason of fitting into a society that expects those things from a woman.It's interesting how Ingmar Bergman's direction offers ambiguity in various scenes. When Lisabet tears up the picture of her son, does Alma witness that or not? When Mr. Vogler arrives he speaks to Alma as if she were his wife, leaving her in a state of confusion. However one of the principal ideas coming out of the film, that the personas of Lisabet and Alma are somehow merging together is one that never crossed my mind, even with the camera tricks of melding the two faces together. As I say, one will have their own thoughts and ideas about what occurs in the story, and who's to say that any one or another is valid or invalid? It's all open to interpretation.What elevates the picture to the rank of pure cinema can be found in it's artistic style and bold cinematography. Notwithstanding the early garish images, the film remains austere throughout with minimal backgrounds. The hospital room and the summer beach house are starkly furnished, as the camera focuses principally on the two women throughout. The story is an existentialist expression of it's director, and if one concentrates on the observation of The Doctor directly to patient Lizabeth, one might catch Bergman's elusive goal, to capture ""the hopeless dream of being, not seeming, but being"".",8/10
Thuppakki,High-octane action thriller,"Written and directed by A.R.Murugadoss, ""Thupakki"" tells us the story of an army man who takes up the mission of eradicating the sleeper cells in Mumbai. He does it almost single-handedly with style and panache, brawn and brain, Tamil movie style. A.R.Murugadoss is back to his old form dishing out an engaging story with almost racy screenplay aided by a best technical team and above all Vijay, that one man entertainment troop. Movie is not without its share of flaws and logical loopholes, as does many great makers' movies are. But what make them click is that they are masters in camouflaging these flaws by a racy narration which leaves the viewers not that much time to think while you are watching the movie. Here A.R.Murugadoss succeeds in doing the same. He flounders in the romantic portion which is marginally better than his previous very dreary ""7 am Arivu"". But there few enjoyable portions in between also.There are at least two or three ""wow!"" moments in the movie which sure would bring goose bumps in most of the viewers. Pre-interval portion is one of the best adrenaline rush scenes in recent times. Another one which warrants mentions is when Vijay emerges out of smoke after shooting one of the terrorists to save the kidnapped girls. These scenes along with the racy screenplay would ensure success. Also the heroism in this movie is not engineered but appears along the flow of the script. Dialogues are another strong point in the movie. There are many hard- hitting dialogs that extol the Indian army and the sacrifices of the army men. Also there are couple of enjoyable humorous dialogs coupled with Vijay's excellent comic timing that rocks the theater.Technically it is one of the best Vijay movies. Santhosh Sivan needs no praise for this movie is like child's play for the great man. His candid shots especially are noteworthy. Srikar Prasad's editing is another astounding aspect of the movie. It is not all racy, where there is need for the pace to slow down he does it with proficiency.Vijay is excellent in a very casual portrayal of an army man accidentally caught in a mission. His body language, Hindi and English diction, comic timing, agility in action sequences and subtle acting makes it one of the best work from him in the recent times next to ""Nanban"". Kajal Agarwal is gorgeous and dances well, though in terms of acting she has nothing much to do. Vidyut Jamwal is excellent, he is more of a Hero material than Villain though he has done a very good job here. Jayaram and Sathyan lend good support.Harris Jayaraj's background score is one of his best in recent times. It makes sure that right amount of adrenaline rush happens in the most crucial of moments in the movie. ""Google google"" and ""Kutti puli kootam"" are awesome dance numbers while ""Vennilave"" is a delectable melody. ""Antartica"" is picturized interestingly while ""Alaika laika"" has good dance movements. ""Poivarva"" is a heart-rending number rightly placed.Agreed there are few moments in the movie that slackens the flow but the larger picture satisfies the audience to a great deal. May be the songs may irritate a few, but when you have a proficient dancer like Vijay, gorgeous damsel like Kajal and above all awesome songs from Harris Jayaraj why wouldn't anyone have songs in their movies.On the whole, 2012 would be remembered as the year in which all the big stars of Tamil cinema fell by the wayside except for this one man, Vijay who has hit bull's-eye not once but twice.",8/10
Stand by Me,I don't get the hype....,"Currently, ""Stand By Me"" is rated #180 on IMDb--a very, very impressive score that would indicate that this is a great film. However, try as I might, I have no idea why the film is rated this highly and I thought the movie was just average to above average and no more. This film is based on a story by Stephen King and is directed by Rob Reiner. It has a very interesting cast of kids all about age 12--Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton--all before they became stars. These four boys decide one summer to go looking for a dead body--the body of a kid who is missing and who was hit by a train. They know about where the body is because one of them overheard one of the older punks talking about discovering it. Almost the entire film consists of the four boys trekking cross-country to find the body. Along the way, they have some adventures, curse a lot and experience togetherness.There were two things I really liked about the film--the nice 1950s music and the acting of two of the characters. Wheaton and Phoenix were blessed to have been given well-rounded and interesting characters to play--and both were outstanding. On the other hand, Feldman and especially O'Connell played characters that seemed much more like caricatures--difficult to believe and rather stereotypical. Something I didn't like was the language, as f-bombs and lots of other nasty language abounded. Now I know that some kids talk like this, that's true, but it tended to make the kids less likable AND made the film less family-friendly--which it easily could have been.Overall, the film really was adequate and nothing special. I expected special but only once or twice (such as with a poignant scene with Wheaton) was I left thinking the film was anything other than a coming of age story and nothing more. I just didn't get it...",6/10
It's a Wonderful Life,"""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town""","I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",10/10
Rebecca,Absolutely perfect Gothic Thriller that has many imitators but few of equal quality.,"I recall the first time I saw this on TV almost 30 years ago on the late show, I had set my VCR to tape it, but woke up to start watching a bit of it, and stayed up all night to watch it all. That's how good a film it is. Daphne Du Maurier's tale of a shy companion who shocks her employer by winning the most desired wealthy widow in England is gripping, suspenseful, and filled with innuendo. Joan Fontaine never gave a more lovely performance as the awkward bride who leaves her hysterically selfish employer (Florence Bates) to marry the brooding Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) and finds animosity from the darkly dressed Mrs. Danver (Judith Anderson) who resents her intrusion because of her devotion to Maxim's late wife, Rebecca. The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim's toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for.If you thought Olivier's Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights"" was dark and somewhat depressing, wait until you meet his more civilized Maxim. Joan Fontaine's bride is as far from Merle Oberon's ""wild and sweet"" Cathy as you can find, but as far as Gothic tales of brooding men and their lost souls go, the two movies make a perfect double feature. Samuel Goldwyn and David Selznick were Hollywood's most famous independent producers, so sometimes their careers are compared. They share many of the same players, and in the case of these two films, the same photographer (Gregg Toland). Fontaine and Olivier work well on screen together, even though they apparently did not share a close working relationship. It is, however, the supporting players who are the shining stars. Anderson's Mrs. Danvers is a role we've already seen on screen (usually played by Gale Sondergaard), but being Anderson's second film (and first in 7 years), there was a lot of curiosity surrounding her considering her reputation as one of Broadway's hottest dramatic actresses. Mrs. Danvers isn't a one dimensional evil housekeeper; You understand her affection for the late Rebecca from the very beginning, and in every movement Anderson makes, you cannot take your eyes off of her. I can't praise her highly enough. Sanders' suave villain (who playfully calls Mrs. Danvers ""Danny"") is extremely likable and almost equal in stealing away the attention of the leads. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce add on a delightful ""pip pip"" quality to their eccentric characters, while in her brief time on screen, Florence Bates is hysterically funny, putting out a cigarette in her cold cream, and coolly telling Fontaine how she can never truly be a ""great lady"".Every moment here is a classic movie memory, from the opening narration to Fontaine's first vision of De Winter, and then, the rainy ride down to where Fontaine sees Mandalay for the first time. The light first quarter darkens the moment we see Anderson pop into view as Mrs. Danvers. A cold pause, then ""How Do You Do"" reveals the tension, and from there, everything is set. Anderson explodes in two scenes-the first where she finds the hiding Fontaine in Rebecca's old room, and later, when Fontaine confronts Anderson after discovering her treachery. The film sags just a bit with the discovery of a body that might be Rebecca's, but that is minor. C. Aubrey Smith is memorable in his small role as Maxim's attorney. The final shot will live on in your memory, just as Mandalay lived on in the second Mrs. De Winter's.While ""Rebecca"" won Best Film at that year's Academy Awards, many film historians prefer the message drama ""The Grapes of Wrath"" as the better film. I find the two rank very close, and also quibble over between the choice of Jane Darwell for Supporting Actress over Anderson's Mrs. Danvers. A big mistake was not nominating Sanders. A BBC version years later is also very good, a bit more faithful to the novel, and benefits from Diana Rigg as a more approachable Mrs. Danvers and a very diva-ish performance by Faye Dunaway in the Florence Bates role. There has also been a European musical version, scheduled for opening on Broadway several seasons ago, but delayed and possibly permanently tossed in the sea under Rebecca's bedroom.",10/10
Anbe Sivam,Anbe Sivam ( Love is God ) - An experience of love,"Ever wondered what keeps humans going? Think of your biggest skill, your best feature and the main reason for your level of confidence. Now what if a tragedy stole this from you? What next? How will you face the world? Will you be able to love yourself again? This movie answers these and beyond. The movie which is better related to as an experience will leave you awestruck in every possible way.The story is about a journey shared by two people - Nalla Sivam aka Nalla(Kamal Haasan), an experienced, physically challenged, middle aged guy and Anbarasu aka A.Aras ( R. Madhavan ), a short tempered, immature, good at heart youth from Bhuvaneshar to Chennai ( Along east coast of India ). Nalla, being the matured he is, teaches Aras that it is love that is god! He takes us along with Aras through an emotional havoc which leaves our heart with no space but for love. Nalla's heart touching flashback, the words he utters to show his brotherly love to Aras, and the way their stories converge, are few of the many brilliant moments this movie has to offer. The movie poses strong philosophical views to those deep thinkers. It's title ""Anbe Sivam"" can also be seen to imply that Anbarasu is Nalla Sivam. That is, beyond any truth, you and I are one and the same.This movie is a must watch if you thought miracles happen to change one's perspective.PS : The fact that it is directed by Sundar C may come as a shock to any 2000's kid who would have been most vulnerable to his recent ventures.",10/10
Casablanca,I will always remember this....,"And certainly this is Hollywood movie making at its finest, a film that by accident went from an intended standard propaganda war film to unforgettable blockbuster. An early showing in New York made this a 1942 release that didn't make it Oscar eligible, and it's easy to see it taking the prize over the excellent but not as good ""Mrs. Miniver"" since this didn't get wide release (and an L. A. premiere) until early 1943.The success of the movie cannot be pinpointed to one source, because everything that brings this movie together is started from the screenplay, and spread out to the cameraman, director, musical score and the excellent technical team, with even the smallest roles brilliantly cast. You can say that there was an angel over-the-shoulder at Warner Brothers guiding director Michael Curtiz and fully realized to the pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.Bogart wasn't exactly a huge star at the time, having just achieved his first huge success with ""The Maltese Falcon"", and Bergman had been in a few moderately successful films that didn't indicate that she had superstardom ahead of her. This assured legendary status for both, and their single pairing on screen is incredibly perfect, aided by the fact that they never worked together again.For the villains, you have Conrad Veidt as the evil Nazi officer and in smaller roles Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Litre. Claude Rains is initially a character of ambiguous description, but he becomes the moral conscience of the film as you get to know him. He's hysterically funny, especially when he is ordered by Veidt to shut down the casino and then given his gambling winnings after indicating shock that gambling is going on.Bland on the surface, there's much more to Paul Henreid's character than you see on the surface. You can see what drew him and Bergman together yet understand what draws her to Bogart. It's a no win situation for her because she does indeed love both men even if the passion for Bogart is greater. Chance for long term happiness comes with Henreid.Then there's the comic relief of S. Z. Sakall, a character who is much more wise than he lets on, and the soulful performance of singer Dooley Wilson who shows great support for Bogart with great heart and intelligence as well. Wilson easily could have been a supporting actor nominee for this film because he is legendary in this film, and once you've heard him sing ""As Time Goes By"", you'll never forget it.I can watch this film over and over and never be bored. There are films that are classics in a way that over the years has made them notorious and films that have stood the test of time because they are just brilliant. This one fits in the class of the later description, a film so perfect in its casting. This is a film that is completely flawless, patriotic and moving, funny and romantic, and like the sequence where the Nazis sing their anthem while the Allies sing theirs, it is a film that makes viewer stand up and cheer when the good guys win and the bad guys are dealt with in a way that film villains should be.",10/10

The Shawshank Redemption,All-time prison film classic,"Based on a novella by Stephen King, this is better than even THE GREEN MILE and goes to show that you don't need supernatural elements in a prison story – the setting is enough to carry a film as it is. SHAWSHANK often shows up as the ""best film of all time"" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever.",10/10
Dor,Simplicity at it BEST!!,"This movie has touched some really important topics like friendship, kindness, empathy, love and the strength that these emotions have when humans show these to others.
On the acting front, everyone was marvellous and the lead characters did complete justice with their roles. The story is good and the dialogues are simple and blend completely with the plot and background of the movie.In nutshell, a beautifully made wonderful movie!!",8/10

Klaus,Beautifully animated Christmas tale,"It's refreshing that we can still get new Christmas classics. Because I think this film has a fairly hefty chance of ending up as one. Animated by Sergio Pablos and his animation studio, and distributed by Netflix, Klaus is the story of Jesper, a privileged, pampered heir to an enormous postal empire, who ends up being sent to a remote island to run its deserted post office. There he ends up inadvertently starting the myth of Santa.The film is, first of all, absolutely gorgeous. Hand-drawn animation is such a dying art form these days, that it's always a feast for the eyes to see one, but even despite that this would be an eye-popper. Especially how seamlessly the characters blend with the backgrounds, or how soft the lighting can be. Pablos used to work for Disney during their Renaissance and took it up as his goal to take the art form even further. I'd say he one hundred percent succeeded.As for the story, it's nice. Jesper is a bit of a cliché character. A pampered prince forced to work for the first time in his life in a remote village where his heart will finally melt. You've heard this a million times. That being said, the location of Smeerensburg is different enough that it feels kind of new. I also really like the character of Klaus, who's this hulking beast of a lumberjack, who nevertheless speaks rather softly and spends his time making toys. While carrying around an axe big enough to make a Tolkien dwarf proud. Now this is a Santa I can get behind.I like this. It has enough new things to give it a distinct identity, has a nice message, good characters and a gorgeous animation style. What's not to like? I'm definitely checking this out again come next Yuletide.",7/10
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",Sergio Leone's penultimate Italian-western; a film that gets better with each passing year...,"...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone's ""Once Upon a Time"" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan & scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.",10/10
Aamir,"It's a relentless race against time, and we are mere spectators.","Aamir is by far one of the best Bollywood films of all time. An intense action-thriller and a psychological drama at the same time, the film wastes no time in setting up the conflict and eventually putting us in the protagonist's shoes as he's forced to go places and at times, even run for his life! Even thought it's made on a lower budget, the makers seem to have utilized the money by investing it in the right place. No singing, dancing or romancing. Just straight-up tension, and that's one of the many reasons you don't realize how quickly time flies by while watching Aamir.The director has used several elements as metaphors, which is an impressive aspect of Aamir; background characters being mere spectators as Aamir races against time is pretty similar to the viewer's watching him too, as a mere spectator. Dialogues are strong, and it's evident from the opening sequence itself. Amit Trivedi's music is a major plus; since songs are used only in background, they perfectly gel with the visuals. Cinematography and editing are both top-notch and you can easily feel as if you're actually in Mumbai while watching the film. The action sequences are brilliant as well; from several chases to a couple of fight scenes, Aamir's action is as realistic and intense as it can get.Rajeev Khandelwal's performance is the biggest highlight of Aamir. For a film that manages to feel like a one-man show in spite of having multiple characters, Aamir succeeds in redeeming his brilliant performance. Another major applause should go to Gajraj Rao, who's menacing and intense whenever there's a scene involving him. His dialogue delivery can send shivers down your spine: it's that brilliant.With ample twists and turns elevated further by an electrifying background score, Aamir reaches a powerful climax, eventually ending on an intense note. I was so stunned that I couldn't skip the credits. The background song just summed up my feelings. Overall, Aamir is a stunning masterpiece. Don't let go of any chance to watch this film, if you ever get one. I watched it on Netflix, but I'm definitely gonna get a DVD copy to keep it as a collector's item. I hope to find more films like this.",10/10

Spice World,"Wish I could have voted lower than ""1""","I saw this ""thing"" (I can't bring myself to say ""movie"") back in 1997 when it came out.  I went partially out of curiosity and partially because it got some good reviews.  I was appalled!  The girls can't act, can't dance, certainly can't sing and have no personality between them.  There was no plot, all the ""jokes"" were unfunny, all the reputable actors that agreed to show up look embarassed (as they should be).  I usually sit through any movie no matter how bad, but I walked out on this one.  Just simply everything about it was BAD!!!!  And, no it wasn't good enough for laughs. I couldn't even think out things to yell at it...it's one of those movies you just watch in disbelief that something this terrible could be filmed and released.  THank God, they're not making a sequel!  To be avoided at all costs!!!!!!",1/10
Aparajito,Better as a movie than the first one.,"Overall this movie was a better made one than the first movie out of the trilogy; ""Pather Panchali"". Seems like they had a bigger budget to spend this time, which really helps this movie. The story flows also better and is overall more interesting one this time as well, in my opinion.The first movie was still mostly one about growing up, while this one is more a coming-of-age story. It has less sidetracks and characters to distract from the main plot-line, which again is kept as simple as possible. It's why it works out well, though in the end some things fall kind of short, since they don't feel all that likely. It's because this movie took more of a cinematic approach to things, so the story and all of its emotions and drama are also being put on a bit thick. In that regard alone this movie is being a bit weaker and less effective than the first one.Nevertheless, the overall story still flows better and is more pleasant to follow. It definitely helps with this that the story was just more interesting to follow. Director Satyajit Ray inserted some experience he had on his own during his life in this movie as well, though the source material is still being based on the novel written by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. This movie is actually being a combination of the last part of the first novel and the first half of the second one. The third movie out of the trilogy, ""Apur Sansar"", wraps up the all of the stories.Technically this is a better made movie but it's also a great looking one as well, visually. This time the movie for large part gets also set in the big town, which is a quite beautiful sight and captures what life must had been like for the average struggling citizen back then, in India.A nice done drama.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8/10
Charlie,Cliché with new toppings,"The movie starts with an independent woman from Bangalore who wants to live a life on her terms and then life takes her for a ride where she becomes anxious about a never met guy and his life and ultimately falls in love with a vagabond hero. The movie is still clichéd with old chemistry where girl falls in love with jobless,down to the earth,fun loving,jovial protagonist.What makes this movie differ is its making and toppings of new generation characters who are all yo-yo(as they call now). We see woman protagonist whether that maybe Tessa or Kani falling in love. The music and BGM scores well with apt situation. There are many clichés 1.Hero-Heroine meets at the start but never sees,again & again Hero Heroine comes across but they don't meet until the last. 2.The independent woman becomes so much like other woman wanting to fall in love with jobless hero ;) 3.Hero helping everyone without thinking of anything The frames,music and lively attitude of the whole movie makes it so much expressive. Director,cinematographer,music,music director and actors added to the clichéd script making it good.Dulqer and Parvathy along with others did a fantastic acting.",7/10
Kaithi,A Hollywood Remake converted into a 'Blockbuster A Grade Action Drama' in Tamil Cinema.,"Kaithi (2019) :
Brief Review -A Hollywood Remake converted into a 'Blockbuster A Grade Action Drama' in Tamil Cinema. Among all the South Action films i have seen till date whether it is on Television or on Mobile, most of them had insensible and unreasonable action sequences to please masses therefore i don't have much interest to watch such films. Somehow, Kaithi made it to my watchlist because of High Rating in IMDb and Bollywood Remake announcement. Now i can say that, Yes, South can make Sensible Action Films with right contect, well executed Action sequences and perfect emotional touch. Kaithi is a fine example of A Grade Action Film (not a thriller at all) which is far far away from those unrealistic and non sense action flicks where any thin hero could take on 40 healthy villains and make them fly high with unseen hidden punches. Apart from Action Kaithi also takes care of proper plotting from the start to the end having all the conflicts at right places. The leading role is amazingly portrayed by Karthi. He was into the character from the first scene and never took it out of him whether it is action sequence or emotional scene. It would be hard for me to forget his image and see Ajay Devgn in Bollywood Remake even though Ajay Devgn is a Great Actor. Rest of the cast is okay but no effective impact from anyone. Lokesh Kanagraj direction is matured which is rare in this genre because he kept the essence and content alive. He did not fall apart for adding comedy and make it just another masala film, rather he made it thrilling which is rare. And despite little dark tone the film became a Blockbuster success which proves that Director's vision to make an original flick in an unoriginal genre was right. Finally a relief from senseless Action flicks in South Indian cinema since Bahubali and KGF.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7/10
A Separation,What's wrong is wrong ... but what's wrong?,"Greetings again from the darkness. This one finally made it to Dallas and it's now clear why it is not only the Oscar favorite for Best Foreign Language Film, but also received a Best Original Screenplay nomination. It's truly that good ... and powerful ... and thought provoking. I caught myself changing my mind more than once on some of the issues these characters faced.The film opens with Nader and Simin (Peyman Moadi and Leila Hatami) in front of a judge to determine if they will be granted a divorce. Simin wants to take their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi, the director's daughter) to study abroad. Nader doesn't disagree with the plan, only the timing. He refuses to leave his Dad, who suffers from Alzheimer's, alone in Iran. In a poignant moment, Nader points out that while his dad may not know him, he still certainly knows his dad. This is the first of a recurring theme throughout ... there are numerous ways to look at every issue.When Simin moves in with her mother, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to be his dad's caregiver. After a few days, Nader and Razieh have a heated argument and he pushes her out of the apartment. Next thing he knows, she is in the hospital after a miscarriage. She files a claim saying Nader pushed her down the stairs causing the miscarriage. The core of the story is the actions of the key characters during the inquisition by the judge/inspector. Nothing seems clear cut and each character's recall and statements vary from moment to moment.A key point is that these are all basically good and moral people. Muslim believers in various stages. None would purposefully sin, yet each is trying to protect something or someone. The script is fascinating in its detail and subtlety. It moves like real life rather than a movie trying to get crammed into a 2 hour window. Written and directed by Asghar Farhad, the film deserves all accolades and acclaim. Let's hope it finds an audience in the U.S. We could certainly use more stories and films like this.",8/10
Good Will Hunting,Manipulative and Heartwarming,"SPOILERS. I can see why this project was greenlighted. It's got everything a Hallmark feature should have -- plus profanity. A love story between a brilliant lower-class boy and a young girl at Harvard. (In the original ""Love Story"" it was more or less the other way around.) A tortured boy barely out of his teens who is a miscreant and unable to expose himself to others and who is not ""in touch with his feelings."" (I've always wondered how you get in touch with your feelings.) Well, it's worked dozens of times before -- ""Blood Brothers,"" ""David and Lisa,"" inter alia. In this instance he's wary of others because he was abused as a child; cf., any of two or three dozen Lifetime Movies for Women. A very human but somewhat remote academic mentor, and a warm, humanistic, unpretentious bearded shrink, as in ""Ordinary People."" A score that tells us when we're supposed to laugh and when we're supposed to tear up. Good, evocative location shooting in Boston. Is Will Hunting going to be able to overcome his fear of commitment, leave Beantown, and find himself emotionally and intellectually? (How do you find yourself?) We viewers want him so badly to choose the right path, which we can discern amidst the murky and myriad possibilities even if he can't, that we feel like we're watching someone trying to shove a boulder and we find ourselves sitting in our seats and humping along with him. Does he make the right choice? Does a bear hibernate in the winter?Well, I'm sorry. I kind of enjoyed the first half hour or so, when Will Hunting's genius is being finally and painfully uncovered. It was kind of confusing though, in a technical sense. Mathematics is one of those creative talents that appears at an early age, rather like genius in music. It tends to peter out in early adulthood. (If you haven't made it as a professional mathematician by the time you're twenty-five you're considered over the hill in academia.) In other words, mathematical genius has a life course of its own, almost, but not quite, independent of what is generally recognized as ""intelligence."" But Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, not only has this isolated talent, but something that resembles a photographic memory as well. He's remembered practically everything he's ever read, which is practically everything ever written, from law to organic chem, although we never see him reading a book. If a kid in my working-class neighborhood ever was caught reading Nietzsche, he'd be twitted to death. Well, eidetic imagery (or photographic memory) really does exist. You can hold up an ordinary comb in front of a kid who ""has"" it, for a few seconds, then put the comb out of sight and the kid will be able to tell you the number of teeth in the comb, because the image in his mind is so clear that he can count them. But, like musical or mathematical genius, it shows up early, in young kids, then tends to fade. And again, it's independent of ordinary intelligence. For one individual, especially at the age of twenty-one, to have both singular geniuses at the same time, is so unlikely as to constitute an irritation for someone watching the flick. I mean, it's like drawing two straight flushes, one after the other. And then too, it makes me squirm when I watch a scene in which a shrink brings up the abuse his client suffered in childhood and then tells him over and over (and over), ""It's not your fault,"" until the client breaks into a cascade of fulsome sobs and the two of them hug one another like Esalen grads. Who ever claimed it was the client's fault in the first place? Why in God's name should the client blame himself for the brutality instead of the foster fathers who are the guilty parties here? (Hint: the script calls for it.) And there are shouted arguments between the academic mentor -- played in a most engaging way by Skarsgard -- and the humanistic shrink -- done devilishly by Robin Williams -- that seem to take place only because they add texture to the picture. Neither the mathematician or the shrink show the slightest evidence of being the shouting type. There's also a shouted argument between Will and his girl friend that isn't called for either, although a simple disagreement would have been plausible. I guess what I'm saying is that this is a commercial product. It could have come out of a course in screen writing taken through Phoenix University. Introduce interesting characters with idiosyncratic traits, pull the audience in, then tug at the plot and the heartstrings. Have a scene in which an emotionally distant person finally breaks down and cries. In the last half of the movie, when the interest may be dying down, pump it up with fights between people we like. This isn't meant as cynicism or a blanket condemnation of the talent involved in the production. Matt Damon is particularly good as a bragging roughnecked Southie. Contrast this performance with what he does in ""The Talented Mister Ripley."" When he and Williams have a quiet confrontation on a park bench, Damon gives the scene entirely to the shrink. Robin Williams does a fine imitation of Oliver Sacks. (Why does he choose so many other poor vehicles?) Van Sandt handles the direction competently, but see ""Drugstore Cowboys"" for a more personal Weltanschauung, in some ways just the opposite of the one presented here. It isn't nearly as heartwarming as ""Good Will Hunting,"" thank Bog.",6/10
Deewaar,Best Actor award,"One of my greatest films of alltime, the film has an eerie, grey feel about it. Amitabh who went on to amazing status really shines and portrays the character who is (based on Haji Mastan a notorious mumbai outlaw)isolated from society and family magnificantly, the role won him best actor 1975. A film richly layered in metaphor and meaning, with deeply powerful dialogues and symbolic significance. The camera work however makes the film look very dated which may put people off watching an old film, but if your not judging a book by the cover, based on sheer performances and script well worth a watch.",10/10
Apocalypse Now,"""What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?""","Back during the Viet Nam War, a friend of mine from my home town returned from the war and described his first day in combat. He was dropped from a helicopter in the middle of a jungle clearing, while simultaneously realizing that the rifle fire coming his way was from enemies that wanted to kill him. I'm not sure how a sane person filters that type of insanity through any kind of rational prism. Perhaps that's what ""Apocalypse Now"" is meant to convey, as virtually every situation presented makes no sense in a rational world. The surreal takes center stage from beginning to end, with river surfing set to a napalm barrage and playboy bunnies appearing out of the night sky aboard a helicopter. For a generation of movie watchers born after the Viet Nam era, scenes like those might seem like the fevered nightmares of a troubled film maker, but for those who lived it, they were all too real. I guess that's why Viet vets referred to 'The World' as anyplace BUT Viet Nam; in today's experience, one might compare that war to a virtual reality video game, except that you could really die in it.I recall back in the day how Marlon Brando's presence in the film was highly regarded and anticipated, yet for all that he's in it for only a relatively short time. It's Martin Sheen's picture pretty much all the way, with a supporting cast that while watching today, surprised me with the likes of Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishbourne, Harrison Ford and Dennis Hopper. Robert Duvall on the other hand, might have cemented his growing reputation here with his 'napalm smell of victory' declaration early in the picture. His portrayal of Big Duke Six Kilgore is the one I remember best from thirty years ago, even though he winds up merely a marginal character.Interestingly, if one were to remove the context of Viet Nam, the picture would still hold up amazingly well, given the universal oxymoron of military intelligence in a Catch 22 world. Captain Willard's thoughts and actions turn conventional thinking on it's head, while forcing the viewer to re-examine one's own ideas about good and evil, right and wrong, humanity and inhumanity. It's not a comfortable picture to watch, and one which defies the generally accepted definition of entertainment. Nevertheless it's almost certainly a must see picture that challenges one's perceptions about war and it's consequences.",10/10
Raging Bull,thing of beauty,"In 1964 New York, Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) is an old overweight man preparing to perform.

His cast is amazing. Joe Pesci is solid. It's amazing that he found the great Cathy Moriarty in her film debut. Then there is Robert De Niro. There are almost no words to describe his performance.

Kahaani,A Nutshell Review: Kahaani,"The film begins in 2008, where we bear witness to an unnamed man whose identity is hidden behind a gas mask, experimenting with a lethal chemical gas on lab rats, before we get to the city of Kolkata where the same weapon of mass destruction got used in a terrorist attack on a subway train that unfortunately wasn't stopped in time. This almost stand-alone setup and prologue will keep you guessing its significance to its story, since the film continues two years later, where Balan's Mrs Vidya Bagchi arrives in the same Indian city from London in search of her husband Arnab (Abir Chatterjee), who as a software engineer worked at the National Data Centre and maintained daily contact until his sudden disappearance two weeks before, with the uncharacteristic cessation of contact prompting his wife to travel thousands of miles to look for him.Worried, the heavily pregnant Vidya heads straight to the local police to file a missing persons report, and from there starts to visit some of the regular joints her husband could have been in, including his hotel room which had absolutely no traces of the man, nor with people she encountered at those places having any recollection of having seen him, based on their hastily taken matrimonial photo. Assisted by policeman Rana (Parambrata Chaterjee), a slight, mild mannered cop, they soon stumble upon an investigative web filled with unanswered mysteries, and a bewildering suggestion that her husband may not be who he had claimed to be all along. The name Milan Damji gets floated about, a government agent in the mould of Jason Bourne, who may hold the key to Arnab's disappearance, again with clues that he may be more than meets the eye, and at this point your imagination will start to run wild as to the myriad of possibilities the story written by Sujoy Ghosh could turn out.Ghosh also takes on directing responsibilities, and he has crafted one heck of an engaging thriller amongst some of the best I've seen with scheming twists and carefully plotted turns involving government officials, beat cops, and Intelligence Bureau officers led by the non- compromising Khan (Nawazuddin Sidiqui), who epitomizes a no-nonsense approach with a willing streak to sacrifice pawns to nab the king. With Vijay pushing for the truth, a slew of bodies start turning up courtesy of a hired killer set loose to silence everyone she talks to, giving rise to that sense of danger and death at every wrong turn, it's a closely matched up cat and mouse game everyone seems to be playing against one another on both sides of the law, with Khan's questionable tactics giving rise to the propensity of collateral damage authorities are willing to suffer for the sake of the greater good.But Ghosh also remembered to balance his superb thriller with emotional anchors, and does this brilliantly through his crafting and development of the protagonists Vijay and Rana, whom we journey together in their search for facts and truth. They play off each other's strengths like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, with Rana's unassuming disposition balancing Vijay's sprightly nature and relentless determination, making this one of the best cop- civilian pairing I have ever seen as well, being all natural and therefore believable. Credit has to go to Vidya Balan for her sensitive portrayal as a woman hell bent on tracking down her loved one and seeking closure to the sudden mysteries in her life, and Parambrata Chaterjee for his portrayal of a man taking it upon himself to help, and unwittingly finding himself being attracted to and infatuated with someone he has sworn to protect as well. It is this forbidden attraction and romance that's underlying and brewing that he brings out well without going over the top, exhibiting loads of sentimentalism that worked wonders for their chemistry with each other.Production values are top notch. I absolutely love the gorgeous city of Kolkata which I've seldom seen in Indian films, and here we weave in and out the crowded, bustling city area and into much laid back neighbourhoods, with a fantastic capture of very natural misc-en- scene being a lovely ode to the city, featuring its sights, sounds, people such as the working class from tea sellers to master craftsmen, and festivals. Production designers Kaushik Das and Subrata Barik ensured a very natural look and feel, while cinematographer Setu didn't impress me much with his shaky cam technique that had plagued too many Hollywood films he tried to emulate, but thankfully the second half of the film decided to ditch that misguided documentary feel for camera work that's more sustainable and traditional. The music by Clinton Cerejo and Shekhar Ravjiani worked extremely well in the background without bringing in too much attention to itself, nor do we have jarring breakaway musical interludes to blunt the storyline. Such is how everything worked together to complement everything else in the making of the film, to churn out a result that's worthwhile of repeat viewings for clues that one may have missed the first time round. It's filmmaking and storytelling at its best, and even I was more than glad to have decided to watch this instead of postponing it. Kahaani propels itself into my shortlist as one of the best this year, and it is certainly highly recommended if you're desperately looking for an intelligent story, great performances, a film that went the whole nine yards in its desire to become a classic.",10/10
The Bandit,The tragedy of Uncle Baran can be predicted at the beginning of the film,"The tragedy of Uncle Baran can be predicted at the beginning of the film, but the process is twists and turns. Like the awakening of Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, Eskiya tells a similar story. A bully little rogue / newbie, and an uncle who has retired for many years, and his awakening are all related to the unexpected death of his friend. If Unforgiven is still in the western mode, the protagonist and the protagonist halo, the story of Uncle Baran of Eskiya seems even more sad. I think the evaluation of this movie should be similar to Unforgiven. If there is a need to find some gaps, I think there are two main points:
1. Turkish
2. Baran's actors are not handsome enough",8/10

Hindi Medium,Much much better than the over-hyped Bahubali.,Hindi Medium is a situational comedy based on social issues. It's a family-oriented story of a couple who is determined that their three year- old daughter should study in an English medium school and they leave no stone unturned to achieve this goal. The acting by the lead male actor is the major plus point of this film. Have seen the male lead in various Hollywood films. The guy has amazing comic timings. The female lead was kinda OK.

The Pianist,Over-rated story of survival,"I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment",4/10
Pulp Fiction,"""That was f----n' trippy""!","Quentin Tarantino may have broken the mold with ""Pulp Fiction"". Great actors in great performances, smart dialog, and an eclectic ensemble cast make this one of the rare gems in cinematic history. As a fan of non-linear story telling in movies, I found this one a unique challenge, as you get so absorbed in each of the vignettes that it's difficult to double back and figure out where the circle got broken. You'll have to watch this one more than once, and even so, it never gets boring, with mind blowing sequences like those at Jack Rabbit Slim's and Mia's hypo in the chest cure - Whoa!!! But don't take my word for it. You'll have to view the film with sufficient time set aside for liberal use of the re-wind button because it's so unlike anything you're likely to see short of another Tarantino flick.",10/10

Pizza,"Probably, The best use of ""Deux Ex Machina"" ever done in thriller genre. Meet World's First horror-con-thriller ever.","Pizza (2012) :
Brief Review -Probably, The best use of ""Deux Ex Machina"" ever done in thriller genre. Meet World's First horror-con-thriller ever. I think i have given away too much in the first two lines only which might turn a big spoiler unless you don't think about it too much. So, first you should know what is ""Deux Ex Machina"". If you know it then it's great and if you don't then please go to Wikipedia and read about it there. That will save some copy-paste work for me in this BRIEF review. So, now you know what that term means basically and let me tell you it's not complex as you think. Actually, we all have been through it with many comedy films over the years but just didn't think that it could mean something intricate like this. So better leave it UNSOLVED and that's what it means here. Pizza is horror film but we all know that there's nothing like ghosts and all so we start finding solid reasons for it. Remember, Malayalam Classic 'Manichitrathazu'? Even that belongs to horror genre but as we all know it's not a real thing so we start finding logic into it. That film provides it by the perfect use of Psychological medical terms so while watching Pizza you also wish there would be something logical at the end to cover all the unrealistic loopes. It's a sign of an intelligent movie viewer who easily don't believe in spilled stuff and rather likes to wait for intriguing turnarounds. With Pizza, the same thing happens. They show you horror images because you are a smart movie buff, you don't believe it and wait for the suspense to get revealed. A pizza delivery boy lands in a mysterious circumstance and it works a dramatic change in his life. I am not spoiling anything here because i want you to watch the film without any speculations and i am sure it will blow you away. It's little predictable but still very hooked and surprising. Thanks to Team Pizza for trying something different and for me that's the best thing about it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",8/10
Ikiru,Ikiru,"From director Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai), I read a short description about this film after seeing it being featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it certainly sounded like a worthwhile watch. Basically set in post-war Tokyo, Japan, longtime bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (BAFTA nominated Takashi Shimura) works in a city and spends his whole working life doing nothing at all, just like his other office colleagues. Then one day he goes to the doctors who tell him has a tumour, and after hearing about the consequences of terminal cancer, he is sure this is what he has, stomach cancer, and he is slowly dying. With this looming over him Watanabe wants to find some meaning in the time has left, less than a year, but he is unable to talk to his family, and is unfulfilled spending a night with a novelist. Next has a chance encounter with one of his female fellow office workers, and this encourages him to make a change in the office work ethic, but actually doing something and doing it efficiently. After having some happiness with this woman and making some difference to the bureaucracy, Watanabe does indeed die, and his fellow workers debate about what he did before his death and why, but they resolve to be like him. Also starring Nobuo Kaneko as Mitsuo Watanabe - Kanji's Son, Kyôko Seki as Kazue Watanabe - Mitsuo's Wife, Makoto Kobori as Kiichi Watanabe - Kanji's Brother and Kumeko Urabe as Tatsu Watanabe - Kiichi's Wife. Shimura gives a credible performance as the old man struggling to go on with any kind of regular life with the thought of death, but finding some resolution, and the story in many parts is indeed moving and certainly doesn't disappoint you with you how you feel for the lead character, certainly a must see foreign language drama. Very good!",8/10
Earth,Very intense film. Superb acting by the Dangal guy.,"The story is set in Lahore (now the capital of Pakistani Punjab) in the time period directly before and during the partition of India in 1947 at the time of Indian independence.A young girl with polio, Lenny (Maia Sethna), narrates the story through the voice of her adult self (Shabana Azmi). She is from a wealthy Parsi family who hope to remain neutral to the rising tensions between Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims in the area. She is adored and protected by her parents, Bunty (Kitu Gidwani) and Rustom (Arif Zakaria), and cared for by her Ayah, a beautiful Hindu woman named Shanta (Nandita Das). Both Dil Navaz, the Ice-Candy Man (Aamir Khan), and Hassan, the Masseur (Rahul Khanna) are Muslim and in love with Shanta. Shanta, Dil, and Hassan are part of a small group of friends from different faiths (some of who work for Lenny's family) who spend their days together in the park. With partition, however, this once unified group of friends becomes divided and tragedy ensues.",10/10
Green Book,"A captivating watch, with sensational acting.","Not often these days so I give ten stars to a film, with Green Book however, I had no other choice, this film had me totally captivated.It's a fascinating story, I had no idea that it was based on true events, temporarily losing his job at a club, Tony Lip Vallelonga gets a job driving for Doctor Don Shirley. Shirley has a specific reason for touring in the deep south.It's one hell of a journey (I know it's a term that's easily bandied about in films, but it's appropriate here,) physically and emotionally, it's a battle of wills, ideas, concepts, each man learns something from the other. You see the true horror of what Shirley faced in day to day life, from buying a suit, to eating dinner.The acting, is simply outstanding, you couldn't put a pin between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the pair are unbelievable in this film, it's no wonder awards came flooding in.It looks sensational, they brought 1962 to life, and the music throughout is spot on.I laughed, I sobbed, I connected, a cinematic triumph, Green Book is an incredible film. 10/10.",10/10
Wild Tales,Creepily effective black comedy,"If you've been feeling a mite cocky about where your life is headed of late, you might want to take a gander at ""Wild Tales"" for a much needed reality check. This omnibus Spanish feature, sharply written and directed by Damian Szifron, offers a series of very dark, very disturbing and sometimes very humorous vignettes, all centered on chance (and not so chance) encounters that go awry in unexpected and often tragic ways. The movie makes it clear that, while you may think you have control over your life, in the grand scheme of things, you're really just a pawn subject to the whims of other individuals, a soulless bureaucracy or, most chillingly, a cruel and mocking Fate. However, in two of the cases, the participants do manage to wrest control back from the outside forces and determine the course of their lives - to some extent, at least.As is often the case with these kinds of morality tales, most of the scenarios rely heavily on situational irony to get their points across. I won't detail the various stories (you really need to experience them for yourself), but I will note that the first one, involving an airliner, comes uncomfortably close to an actual event that occurred after the movie was released. Segments one and three contain the most visceral impact, while others cut deeper psychologically. Even the tones vary from one storyline to another. For instance, the final story, about a wedding that turns into a surrealistic nightmare, is shot through with pitch-dark humor. Replete with sharp performances from a talented cast, the movie touches on such universal human themes as revenge, road rage, class privilege, all tied to the sense of powerlessness one feels when confronted with forces bigger than oneself. In its own subtle, quiet way, the movie has a remarkable ability to keep the audience on the edge of its seat, filled with a kind of gnawing dread as we await the catastrophe we sense is just over the horizon. As with all the best horror tales, Szifron understands that the anticipation is often more terrifying than the actual event when it finally arrives. The movie as a whole has a way of unnerving us while it drives home some unpleasant and uncomfortable truths about what it means to be human.",8/10
Border,Another stupid Indian war film,"Border is about a small military confrontation between India and Pakistan. The facts have been mutilated and heroes have been made larger then life. It was the Indian air force that made a real difference to the outcome. In the movie it is a handful of soldiers that do the job. Even the cook has to take up arms. Apart from an incorrect plot there is hopeless acting and stupid stunts. Take for example a soldier who carries an anti tank mine to a tank after being shot around 20 times all over the body. You can count on more such scenes in the movie. The movie was a big hit in India and the director won acclaims for his direction. Every major characters has a love life and the romance side of their stories makes the movie agonizingly long. Aside from all this junk the movie has some brilliant songs exploring the soldiers life far from his family. ""Sandeshe aaten hain"" is about soldiers waiting for a message from home, letters ask them . ""Jaaten hue lamhon"" is about a soldier asking the time to stop because he wants to spend a little more time with his newly wed wife.",5/10

The Brawler,"It's not Gangs of Wasseypur, but Bombay Velvet neither.","The movie starts with a quote 'Inspired by true events'. This is where people who come for content find their head held high. It is also because of the person who has directed the movie - Anurag Kashyap. A person who keeps art to its minimum and reality to its maximum, which itself is an art.For me when I watched the movie, the other two movies that went through my mind were 'Saala Khadoos' and 'Brothers'. There's a saying movies run because of three factors, 3x entertainment.This is where the movie falls as unees bis.The ending could have been anything just like reality, so no comments on that one.Acting: Vineet Singh acted really well, so did other actors.I am comparing it with Gangs of Wasseypur, mostly because I don't think it would get that crowd. The other comparison is of cinema.Final Verdict: Worth adding to your dvd collection.",8/10
The Prestige,Imperfect but fascinating,"As said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.Was also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.However, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.The story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.Fine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.Overall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8/10
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,A Nutshell Review: Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,"Made in collaboration with Capcom, I think someone probably thought enough time had past and the past stinker forgotten, and to follow suit in a franchise milking programme like what Marvel and DC had embarked upon, a reboot is in order and the current buzzword. So just like how the characters in Street Fighter hail from all over the world, the production too has input from everywhere, like actors in the West and in the East, being filmed in Thailand and having Indian producing input as well. It's like a melting pot of cultures collaborating in breathing life into a possible franchise should this film prove to be successful. But chances are I suspect it'll at most hit the direct to DVD route after this.It's a little surprising that the filmmakers opted for Chun Li instead of the signature character of Ryu. Maybe they have faith in Kristin Kreuk, better known for her Lana Lang role in Smallville, to pull in the fanboys, or once fanboys, of the video game. But as it turns out, while she may be a looker, and her personal grounding in gymnastics and martial arts do help, she's ultimately let down by a weak plot (ok, so that's expected) and some very weak supporting characters. On the side of the good, you have Cheng Pei Pei in a one scene cameo, who does nothing but to tell her to go to Bangkok and live like a pauper, useless cops with Chris Klein as an Interpol cop Charlie Nash who's basically cardboard and Moon Bloodgood (love that name) as a Thai policewoman Maya who just preens and purrs, and Robin Shou as Gen, a mystical David-Carradine-Kung-Fu knock off with long grey hair.As if the villains were good enough, being nothing but bland and uninteresting. I thought it was a good spin on things to have Neal McDonough's Bison being a corporate raider with his Shadaloo organization, aided by lesbian femme fatale Cantana (Hong Kong's Josie Ho), a very underused Vega (Black Eyed Peas' Taboo) and Michael Clarke Duncan's Balrog, who's more like a relegated Kingpin of Crime from Daredevil, now playing sidekick. Like Robin Shou, who also once had leading role status, I feel that this film was like a collection of would be has- beens waiting for another chance at the big league.If there's any cause for celebration, then it might be Edmund Chen's role as Chun Li's dad Heung. From Ivan Heng to Adrian Pang to Fann Wong and to the coup of seeing Chin Han having possibly the role of his life in The Dark Knight, Edmund Chen looks set to follow in the latter's footsteps, but only up until some stuntmen unceremoniously took over almost all his fighting scenes, even those that require him to perform some non-life threatening qi- gong stances. The body double is really too obvious and one can tell it isn't him at all. So shave off some 50% of his ""appearance"" from the film.Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li is a straight forward film without much depth in its story, and it's relatively lower production budget translates to many of the jazzy special prowess in the game being considerably toned down. Perhaps director Andrzej Bartkowiak's intention was to have it more rooted to reality, but therein lies the danger see, because this film has tremendous parallels with that of another super-powered movie called Elektra. Both have recognizable female actresses in the lead role, and they share a plot involving secret organizations, mystical healing, an experienced teacher to learn the ropes from, and plenty of hokey martial arts. Even the training sequence looks super summarized, uninspiring and filled with unremarkable, clichéd dialogue.Having said that it was more rooted in reality, that doesn't mean there weren't fun opportunities for some game-like signature moments. I had enjoyed how Bison power packs his punches and kicks, just like in the game but without any glowing-blue glove to visually enhance it (just throbbing sound effects). Chun Li doesn't appear in her iconic qipao, but makes up for it in one scene where she has to execute her Tenshokyaku, the spinning bird kick where she inverts herself and spins her legs like helicopter blades, and dons her hair ""ox horns"" style. Other than that, her costume's pretty much well suited for the heat and humidity of the Bangkok temperature, as well as the usual black ensemble made hip by X- Men.It had tried to be more cerebral in crafting a father-daughter story between Chun Li and dad Heung, Chun Li and her master Gen, and that between M.Bison and her daughter Rose. But anything in depth has no place in the film as it opted to be more fleet-footed that even a three year old could follow. It's an origin story, and depending on which camp you're on, you may or may not agree with some of the tweaks made here to accommodate the film version of things. Despite being called ""Street Fighter"", the fights here are nothing too fantastic or memorable, and looks comfortably in place with many B-grade action movies out there, with the occasional lapsing into the crutch of having the fight scenes edited in double quick time.I suppose the filmmakers had tried their best, but there's a lot of room to try harder and come up with a better product. The lead to the sequel involves a martial arts tournament, but please don't go down the same road as Mortal Kombat and the likes. Come up with a proper and stronger story, and perhaps, we could get a chance to see a franchise being developed, straight to the cinema or DVD market. I'm willing to give it a shot, even with or without Kristin Kreuk returning.",4/10
La Haine,Very much a young person's film,"Very much a young person's film both in style and temperament stunningly shot in wide screen monochrome by Pierre Aim and covering 24 hours in the lives of three friends from a Parisian housing estate in the aftermath of a riot in which a fourth member of their clan has been shot and seriously wounded by the police. Fundamental to events is a gun lost by the police and found by Vinz, one of the boys in question, who has vowed that if his friend dies he will kill 'a pig'.It's an exciting, visceral, nihilistic picture influenced by the likes of Scorcese and filmed with much the same documentary like precision that Pontecorvo applied to ""The Battle of Algiers"" and an influence in turn on the work of British directors like Shane Meadows. A pre-credit prologue in which we are told of a man falling to his death from a 50-storey building should alert us to the fact that no matter what the outcome it isn't likely to be a happy one for anyone concerned. Writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz has no illusions about happy endings and violence and the prospect of a sudden, early death figures large in the lives of the protagonists.It's not a great film; it's too much of a patchwork quilt of outside influences but it is brilliantly made, it's full of energy and it clearly marked out Kassovitz as a director worth watching.",8/10

Don,"Great style, great Bachchan, and hardly a dull moment","Don is a true classic thriller of the 1970s, and it surpasses the usual fare of the times in both story and execution. The film is extremely well shot, and Chandra Barot's direction is very good. The film gave me Bond vibes as I was watching it - everything about it from very early in the film is really stylish, the camera work is great, the sets, decorations, costumes, score, sound - everything boasts of very high production values. What makes the magic in the end is the script, which is tense and twisted and really well etched out, and, guess what else, oh, well, who else if not Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, who is excellent in his dual roles, and his presence alone does much to captivate the viewers. What almost takes away from the magic is the ending, which turns the film into a sort of slapstick comedy, unintentionally I guess, but it is forgivable because most films of the genre end on similar notes. The film has many other great things going for it, including great music, a lovely leading lady in Zeenat Aman, and impressive turns from the famous character actors Pran and Iftekhar. There's hardly a dull moment in this film. It's nostalgic and highly entertaining.",8/10
Singin' in the Rain,"""Gee I'm glad you turned up, we've been lookin' inside every cake in town.""","Just a great piece of Golden Age Hollywood entertainment, and this coming from someone who doesn't generally take in a musical complete start to finish. The 'Singin' In The Rain' number I could watch over and over again, it strikes a wonderful balance of joy, freedom and artistic expression. Besides that, it's flawless, making me wonder if it could possibly have been done in one take. Curious though, if you watch closely, you won't see any 'rain' hitting Gene Kelly's face.Though it's primarily Kelly's vehicle, I was sure impressed by the little bit of dance time Donald O'Connor got. That 'Make 'Em Laugh' number was funny and bold, and if I had to say, might have been the best part of the film. OK, for me it was, without taking anything away from Kelly, especially the numbers done with the exotic Cyd Charisse. Growing up in the Fifties and Sixties, one would see all of these greats appear on a variety show every now and then, but this movie puts into perspective just how great each performer actually was.It seems to me the film got away with quite a bit in the sly innuendo department, some cleverly low key and some right out there. The Kelly/Charisse flapper number gets downright steamy at times even while it looks as innocent as all get out. For a head spinning double take, you don't get much more brazen than Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) - ""Well I can't make love to a bush.""""Singin' In The Rain"" is one of those films that will continue to wear well and entertain audiences for a long time to come. It captures the grandeur of that Hollywood Golden Age without getting overly theatrical and choreographed, and with a great blend of romance and comedy mixed into the story. It's the kind of film they don't make anymore, and in a way, that's just a bit too bad.",10/10
Hacksaw Ridge,Born to Kill meets Peace.,"Do any of you fine people remember Full Metal Jacket? Pvt. Joker in Vietnam has a helmet that features the words ""BORN TO KILL"" on one part and right by it is a peace symbol. He is asked about it by a superior officer who finds it to be a sick joke, and Joker responds that it's part of the ""duality of man, the whole Jungian thing."" In that sense, Hacksaw Ridge is the most Jungian war movie ever made, and I'm not sure if that's entirely a great thing. It may be fascinating after the fact, that it could be a film that's worth talking about after it ends, but while watching it this dichotomy is bizarre. I think part of this too goes back to Francois Truffaut's quote about war movies, that it's very difficult, close to impossible, to make an anti-war film when the action itself makes war look like a bloody good action movie.Platoon was one of the only films to be anti-war and have action in it that was well shot and executed. Hacksaw Ridge isn't that really. Its first half actually does, what I found, a decent and compellingly dramatic job of showing this guy Desmond Doss (sic) and how in his upbringing around a drunk PTSD'd father (a terrific Hugo Weaving) and nearly killing his brother (and, later on we learn, his father too in a fight), it's actually clear to see why he would embrace non-violence so strongly. Even if the guy never picked up a Bible in his life, his experiences inform his worldview, it's just that the word on killing- thou shalt not of course- extends to Doss in a way that is his total conviction. He even has a fairly sweet romance with a girl in the film and all that is fine; if anything the first half of the film, including a training sequence with Vince Vaughn in a role that reminds one how he can do dramatic work (and be funny while doing it), is engaging.But that second half is where Gibson gets to let loose and get into being BLOODY MEL Gibson (ala Bloody Sam Peckinpah, though not anywhere near Peckinpah's real innovations in filming violence in such an eye and rhythm that revolutionized things, this doesn't do that). The battle scenes here could lay claim to being the most gruesome in the history of cinema - at the least somewhere Spielberg has to be going ""damn... that's a bit much"" - and maybe some of that is part of who Gibson is as a (sigh) artist, going back to Braveheart and on through Passion and Apocalypto, a man who seems as compelled to show ALL of the brutality the way that Doss was compelled to never pick up a gun, not once. And objectively, this action is intense and, maybe, in a few moments, exciting and intense as hell.The message of this character can't help but contradict how this filmmaker sees war, and this dichotomy, again going back to that ""Born to Kill/Peace"" ideal, is taken a little too literally to the point where Mel's/Desmond's man Jesus is taken into account here. Another thing structurally is that Hacksaw Ridge feels its length over almost 2 1/2 hours the most in the final stretch, the last half hour, when Desmond becomes a superhero practically speaking (ironically Gibson in interviews has put down superhero movies of the modern era). Is it true that he saved 75 people at this battle? I take the movie at its word, but there comes a point where it makes its hero SO heroic that it strains credulity. I'm not talking about whether it was true in real life, I mean more-so in the scope of the film's interpretation of it. Not to mention, Gibson *does* indulge in the kind of violence that I have to wonder if the real Desmond Doss would recoil at, including showing a (I think) Japanese general committing Harakiri at the moment of realizing the battle really is over. Uh... okay! If all you're looking for is a bloody, gory, maggots-all-in-the-corpses-and-there-are-the-rats-too action-war movie, then certainly it's inarguable Gibson delivers, and it's a step up in quality from the (I know I'm alone in this opinion I don't care) schlock that was his last film 10 years ago, Apocalypto. But that split between the hero's convictions, religious or otherwise, and how much this film basically revels in this brutality of the flesh, is hard to take. I felt exhausted by the end of this, for good and bad reasons. 6.5/10",6/10
Maqbool,"Dark, Tall and Handsome !","The movie is dark, but it towers above the rest of Bollywood and surely beautiful! Vishal Bharadwaj's direction is top-notch.Pankaj Kapur is brilliant as ever. Its pretty sad when you see him doing silly roles on TV. The way he has sunk Abbaji character into himself is truly amazing! A very powerful presence.Irfan Khan is impressive.Tabu shines ! She is by far the only one that comes to mind (in Bollywood) who combines beauty and brain! An acting prowess in the likes of Shabana Azmi added with glamour! A very rare combination indeed. I wish the directors take more advantage of this explosive combination and create some masterpieces in coming years.Music: I cannot fall short of praise for Vishal Bharadwaj for his multi faceted persona, a producer-director-writer-musiccomposer : where do you see so much rolled into one? Maachis music still echoes in my ear. A true gem in Bollywood.In Maqbool, Sultan Khan's voice has been used so beautifully. His voice is just intoxicating. 'Dheemo Re' is beautiful. The song 'Jhin Minni' has some signature style of Rehman. Few other songs like Chingari display a nice collage of western instrumentation and Indian classical infused vocals.Gulzar's screenplay is excellent. Cinematography is above avg (could be better). Naseerudding Shah and Om Puri have done perfect justice to the little roles they were given.There are some scenes that will make you cringe! This is a matured Bollywood product, and to be watched with same expectation! A serious, no-farce product from Bollywood off late.",8/10
L.A. Confidential,The Fox Is Guarding the Chicken Coop!,"This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichéd. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy.",9/10
Iqbal,Neat and simplistic take on life,"This movie builds up a nice ethos by using a child protagonist as main character. That he's a budding cricketer who has to overcome a physical handicap along with the nearly impossible overall odds of selection, only adds to his sparse attributes and makes him even more endearing.Having said that, the movie could have taken it up a notch in certain places where it loses steam. For instance, its bad enough to convince a coach, let alone an ex-cricketer who's an acknowledged loser, to get up and give you lessons. BUt there's more than one way to skin the cat. In most cities, towns and villages all over India, what is practiced is a sport called ""galli cricket"" (playing in a lane or road with zero or no traffic). That is how many a cricketer (Sachin?) was born. Very few of the youngsters have access to proper coaching, let alone an academy.The plot seems to have been based on Shwaas (little boy's final hurray before sinking into darkness) and Bend It Like Beckham (battling all of the usual resistances). However, Iqbal shines on its own merit and had there been a wider percolation amongst the cine-going audiences, in all probability it would have been a winner at the BO too. Although its a low-budget picture, it doesn't seem to scrimp on technical aspects nor on production values. But the Muslim angle was unnecessary. Again, its triply impossible for a minority, deaf-and-mute, village kid to chase the dream that Iqbal does.Some scenes and dialogs (state selection process) remind you of Kevin Costner's ""Field of Dreams"". Overall, its an enjoyable film. Well done, Nagesh Kukunoor, after Hyderabad Blues, Teen Deewarein, etc. In movies as in cricket, what matters is a unique style, pace and rhythm.",6/10

The Bridge on the River Kwai,A War Film About Individuals,"The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British World War II film by David Lean based on The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942–43 for its historical setting. It stars William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa. The film was shot in Sri Lanka (credited as Ceylon, as it was known at the time). The bridge in the movie was located near Kitulgala.The Bridge on the River Kwai opens in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Burma in 1943, where a battle of wills rages between camp commander Colonel Saito and newly arrived British colonel Nicholson. Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various ""persuasive"" devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears, having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. Brilliant is the word, and no other, to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture.Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals for it speaks of the code of honor amongst men during war, the respect shared by enemies of war, and the madness which war evokes.In short,this complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.",10/10
Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation,This Next Generation is like Coke II,"Oh. My, my, my. Why even bother watching/reviewing Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (or Part IV) other than my obsession in completing a franchise /series reviews for my site?* Part 2 was vile. Part 3 was worse. Part 4 fell even further. But I honestly don't see any real point in diving in on how bad and badly made this diseased series has become. A quick summary was it appeared to be completely improved, no script, no consistency and no reason for Leatherface (now with yet another new family – reason ??) to be a drag queen.Prom Night occurs and incredibly dumb kids get lost, blah blah, they're lead back to yet another creepy house and seated around another disgusting table, blah blah, they're terrorized. Only this time – spoiler! Actually in this case I don't mind spoiling, as it might save you more time to spend with loved ones than watching this crud – they introduce some dominatrix male in a suit who controls everything for whatever dumb reason. I believe this was to lead into a part 5 that (THANK GOD) never happened, much like the open ended plot holes that happened in both at the end of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and Aliens Vs. Predators.As much as I was angry at life after Texas Chainsaw 2 and 3, I think I just gave up during this viewing. Sure, as bad as the predecessor sequels were, this takes the absolute cake in horrible film making. It has wretched acting, intolerable dialogue and a pointless script.Despite the fact I wouldn't normally agree with actors attempting to halt film releases when they have already completed a film, I have to side, just for the extreme embarrassment defense, with both McConaughey and Zellweger's feeble attempts to stop Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation from being freed to the world. Unfortunately they lost. What kind of world do we live in when OJ (originally) walks and this movie is distributed. There is no justice after all.Does it go without saying: SKIP IT? * - Side Note: I did go out of order. I first rewatched TCM Remake, then the remake's prequel, followed by TCM 2, 3 and 4. I still have to go back to the absolute beginning to complete the series of reviews. I do pray they don't make any more.",1/10
Toy Story 3,"To me, this is by far and large the best Pixar film to date!","To me, Pixar have never yet made a bad film, even their weakest Cars is actually very good. Like a lot of people here, I grew up with and loved the first two Toy Story films and still love them. As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.Perhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.The animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.The pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.I was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.Another strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.As ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.In conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10/10

Asuran,A Revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination and higher class oppression.,"Asuran (2019) :
Brief Review -A Revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination and higher class oppression. Tamil Movie Asuran has 2 strong sides that can be the 2 big reasons to recommend this film. First, it's a revenge drama filled action which is sure shot safe bet for Masses and second it has explored some serious issues like Discrimination and honour killing for Classes. The film raises a voice against the traditional higher class oppression loudly and also makes it little emotional with the addition of family values. Although, it does not favour too much realism or quality filmmaking, the overall gesture is still at par. An action flick in Tamil Cinema is mostly about entertainment and mainstream masala but Asuran tried to do a little different from mainstream masala just to see whether or not this is the time for Films and audience to move on. Luckily, the film proves it's point that yes, audience is ready to accept such film which can spread awareness and also give pleasure of watching an Action flick at the same time. The high ratings by IMDb users and Public reactions are overwhelming, i didn't agree fully though. Yes i agree that Asuran is a Very Good Movie and one those of those rare actions films having hearth and brain at right place but somehow this is not Outstanding or Extraordinary. Maybe Tamil audience feel it new hence they were overwhelmed but for rest of the audience across the nation and the globe have been through with such films long ago (and i fall in this category). Dhanush, Manju and Ken Karunas are three names to be remembered for acting in this film, rest are okay-okay. Cinematography is bit dragged in action sequences otherwise no complaints. Vetrimaaran's attempt to do an action film with Social message is undoubtedly successful. Overall, A Nice and Definitely watchable film but not anywhere close to Classic tag.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7/10
North by Northwest,"Not My Favorite Hitchcock, But A Classic For a Reason","A Madison Avenue advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is mistaken for a Mr. George Kaplan and kidnapped by thugs Valerian (Adam Williams) and Licht (Robert Ellenstein). He is taken to the house of Lester Townsend on Long Island. There he is interrogated by a man he assumes to be Townsend, but who is really Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). When Thornhill repeatedly denies he is Kaplan and says he cannot cooperate, Vandamm orders his right-hand man Leonard (Martin Landau) to get rid of him.This is a classic tale of mistaken identity -- perhaps the classic tale. And it has a few twists in store, so if that mix-up wasn't enough to keep the mystery going, there's a few more surprises in store.Eva Marie Saint appears as Thornhill's partner in fake crime, in a much more outgoing role than her reserved ""On the Waterfront"" persona. I like her... I can't place why, but she's a solid actress and I think underused.""North by Northwest"" is considered one of the greatest films ever made and the greatest Hitchcock of all. I admit, there's plenty of great scenes and the acting is hard to beat... Cary Grant, James Mason and Martin Landau in one picture? Oh, and that climactic Mount Rushmore conflict... but I don't know. I wouldn't say it's my favorite. Maybe not even in my top three. I'm more of a murder mystery guy, I guess.Or maybe I'm just not big on Cary Grant... hmmm. A great film, to be sure... do see it. I just cannot put my full endorsement behind it in comparison to other Hitchcock, despite what all the critics say.",8/10
I Know Who Killed Me,My wife said it was OK,"I did not mind the movie, but I know who killed me is like watching instead of reading 'The National Enquier"". The acting is bad in spots, and the script was lacking, but in a 'National Enquier' way. The movie had the swank girl counterpart to the good girl. My wife figured out too soon who the murderer was? Way to obvious. Movie geared for a female and teenage audience. I would of liked I know who killed me when I was 17. The twin part with Art Bell is way too much for me too digest. A 'National Enquier' too much ending. Wort renting. 5 or 6 out of 10. Way better than renting Perfume. This movie will not save Lindys career!",5/10
The Brawler,Good movie but slightly below Anurag Kashyap level,"The movie is good with awesome performance by Vineet Kumar Singh(more lead roles should be given to him), Jimmy Shergill and Ravi Kishan. It has a lots of twists and turns, and is very engaging. But I found the movie a bit below Anurag Kashyap level. I felt a little unsatisfied, as it was an Anurag Kashyap movie, so I had greater expectations.The lead actress is also very good in her role, and she near perfectly suits the role she is playing. Good job from whomever selected her for the role. She has unique and fine features.Many times, it disappoints in the twists and turns, as the story goes in a direction which you were not anticipating/expecting, but if you go with the flow, you can't help but appreciate the overall performance of the whole crew.",8/10
The General,"""If you lose this war, don't blame me"".","I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film, but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number #17 on the 2007 version of AFI's Top 100 Movies of all time list. It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997, so even before seeing the picture, I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases, but I have to admit, I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion, but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy, so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side, I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either, so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.What I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. When Johnnie Gray (Keaton) dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army, and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod, the resulting visual was pure genius. The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnie's thoughtful reverie, and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.The other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge. For starters, I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film, and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb - unbelievable.Oh yes, and I can't forget the sequence where Keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks, flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a pre-CGI world, it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed, particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. For that, Keaton deserves accolades.In between all this clever film making however, I just wasn't inspired. The central plot element doesn't hold up for me - if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer, why wasn't he simply told the reason why. One could argue that then, you wouldn't have a picture, but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier, the picture might have taken a different approach, but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. Maybe I'm second guessing a master, but that's what I come away with.Conclusion - if this movie didn't make AFI's Top 100 Film List in 1997, I don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top 20. At the same time, Chaplin's ""City Lights"", in my estimation a superior silent film, fell OFF the list, while ""The Gold Rush"" moved up a few notches. I may not be a professional, but I know what I like, and this one just didn't do it for me.",7/10
Kirik Party,Amazing Movie.. !!,"It's an amazing movie in Kannada Film Industry in recent times, which is fresh, humorous and provides a wholesome entertainment. And most importantly, it lets you remember your college days and cherish those memories.Talking about the making of the film, Rishab Shetty and his team have done a wonderful Job. Editing is Crisp, Songs are melodious and background music suits the scenes very aptly, thanks to the talented Ajneesh loknath. Especially the background music and the song during interval fight scene is just brilliant. It literally gave me goosebumps.Coming to the acting, everyone have done their part very well. Rakshit as a mischievous college student in the first half and later a transformed college goon in the second half, has pulled both the shades perfectly. Rest of the cast, including 2 actress have done commendable job as well.Verdict : It's a must watch film for all the youth. So don't think much. Just go with your gang and enjoy the movie.",10/10
Maheshinte Prathikaaram,Received a standing ovation when the film ended..........,"I went with my family to the theater on the 75th day of Maheshinte Prathikaram. Though I went with high expectations I was welcomed with a huge crowd in the hall (The day was also the release of Batman V Superman) I clearly doubted that it must be the viewers of BvS but surprisingly most of the youngsters and families were in the line for Maheshinte Prathikaram. I went on to watch the film with this in mind.First Half : The film starts with the 8 size lunar's chappal, introduced as symbolic of his coming revenge. the first half was mostly interesting. It revolved around Mahesh, his friends, family, love and Idukki. The Song 'idukki' gave the spectators a glimpse of the life and beauty of Idukki. The director had done well to indulge deep into the characters, but failed to cast a thrilling sensation between the fight. The audience became silent when the fight began, but I found one or two still laughing at the previous frame's joke. The first half ended with hilarious jokes and Mahesh's vow for revenge.Second Half : I saw in the first half one of the most well scripted story and I would definitely say that this film breached my expectations far beyond(better than Premam I would say). The second half did not lose its momentum but slightly lost its balance during the middle of the second half. The film mainly concentrated on comedy. But the first half love failure was also cast as a comedic genre.The second half, as I said was a bit laggy. I felt that most of my near spectators were becoming sleepy.But the film carried on, Fahadh's and Soubin's performance's being the most enjoyed. Babykuttan portrayed by Alancier Lay was the most laughed at character. The female lead roles's performance, was not up to the mark, I would say. The second half sparks in to life (nearing the end) when Mahesh (after learning Kung Fu and investigating about his avenger) returns to take his revenge. The Fight choreography and cinematography was superb, full marks for them. Breaking out of traditional fights, this film concentrated on realism and hand-held visuals.The fight was about 7 to 8 Min's, but that was worth it, Mahesh surely and splendidly avenged him. The film's climax and ending was a bit surprising for everyone. But I expected it to end any time, considering that it is a drama genre. I am not spoiling everything for you, left some twists and turns for you, the romantic scenes and of course his father.Verdict : One Of The Most Dramatic Films Released In Malayalam Ever.8 / 10",9/10
Rock On!!,Not as rocking as expected,"For the most part, ""Rock On!!"", though engagingly realistic and well-acted, is not a particularly rocking movie. Considering it's about a rock band, the film is fairly slow and at times even tedious. There is some depressing feel to it although the viewer may clearly feel the light in the end of a tunnel will certainly come at some point. What I really liked about this film, however, is the portrayal of relationships. I think it was very well done, and it was the film's best-depicted aspect. It was actually the main aspect which pushed the otherwise unmovable narrative forward. The film's concept is interesting, but not really new or unused. It's neither intriguing nor unpredictable.The performances are good in this order: Shahana Goswami is mind-blowing as Debbie. She is an excellent actress with a very natural and intense style and a particularly forceful dialogue delivery. This clearly is the best performance of the film. Arjun Rampal's is the best performance among the male cast, and he is thoroughly convincing in a role that is essentially a very passive one. Prachi Desai acts very well and she is vulnerable and convincing throughout the film. Farhan Akhtar makes a good debut, nothing outstanding though. He is a bit wooden in some scenes, but otherwise okay, and he actually sings very well. Purab Kohli is effective but does not really get that much of a scope.""Rock On!!"" is a one-time watch for me. It has its moments, it has good acting, the music is excellent, but the story is not very well executed. I felt there was much more to show and much more to tell about the rock band. It is done quite realistically and does not go over the top, but it has its share of clichés, unreasonable coincidences and ancient emotions, which neither move nor impress. Nevertheless, I liked the rather positive ending, which in spite of its predictability was quite efficient. The final verdict is above average according to me. I expected something else, but it's just me, watch it and make your own conclusions.",5/10
Pudhu Pettai,Pudhu Pettai,Good movie. Dhanush and everybody acted very well in the movie. Fight scenes in the movie were excellent. Songs in the movie were good but the BGM in the movie were excellent. The movie was not so interesting. The negatives in the film are more violence in the film and vulgar scenes. The movie lagged a lot and the movie was also boring in 2nd half. The movie was not excellent but the movie was good.,7/10
Memento,"See it twice, or more, depending on your brain","Memento, unless you outright hate it for one reason or another, needs to be seen twice. I saw it once and immediately, as a dumb-s*** 17 year old, jumped to comparing to to the backwards-episode of Seinfeld (not, as I should've the Harold Pinter backward-plot construction he was infamous for). Now, years later, little moments and parts of performances remain in the memory. And now, how curious, to revisit the film with a greater knowledge and appreciation for film art and story construction, not to mention going through a few more Christopher Nolan pictures, and... it's much, much better than I remember it. Just luck, I guess.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man on a mission, and he'll go after his wife's rape and murder, that is in reverse. Or really, at the start of the film its the end, and he kills a man named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who we are not sure who or what he's doing there but have some trust that out hero, or just protagonist, knows what he's doing. Does he though? His own tattoos and his own markers are not always the great markers of truth. He says others, like Teddy, lie and can't be trusted, but is it so? The color and B&W photography is symbolic of something, I think, not simply as a gimmick with creating temporal ""present"" and ""past"". It's as if they combine to create a real GRAY area, one where it's hard to tell if Teddy is telling Leonard all he needs to know (though he may be a cop in point of fact, who knows for sure what he has for Leonard, or if he'll help him in the end... not).This is a tricky little movie, but seeing it with eyes fresh and mind ready for anything its really brilliant on the front of construction. A scene ends right where the last one ended, the sequences of Shelby in his motel room punctuate these scenes with his story of another man with short-term memory loss (no ""New Memories"" as he says repeatedly), and it loops back around again. By the end we have a better idea of what happened, and how Leonard was most likely not at all an innocent in the rape and murder of his wife, but we also don't have the certainty of closure. Only in the point of view of Shelby, who is an unreliable narrator, do we have a real semblance of events.The effect is disorientating, but never boring, and the film-making is rich and clever and direct. There's no punches pulled by Nolan this time, and his editing is as elegant as his cinematography (the latter was much more for than the former in his Batman movies). And we feel for the characters, or at least character; especially painful is seeing how Natalie really feels about Leonard, berating him with a dirty mouth and then after being punched for egging Leonard on, sits in the car and comes back in to start the ""new"" memory that will soon fade, much like the polaroid unless its fanned out. The performances rock as well with the script, with Guy Pearce giving a career high point as Leonard (albeit I could just as easily see Steve Buscemi in the role of Teddy).It's a memorable movie, ironic enough, because we care about the character's plight and descent (or is ascent) into/from hell. He has no life except this mystery to unravel, which may be no real mystery at all. It's a post-modern enigma that is fun to watch, again and again.",10/10
